       "['{\"text\": \"South Arabia during World War I\\\\n\\\\nThe campaign in South Arabia during World War I was a minor struggle for control of the port city of Aden, an important way station for ships on their way from Asia to the Suez Canal. The British Empire declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November 1914, and the Ottomans responded with their own declaration on 11 November. From the beginning, the Ottomans had planned an invasion of Britain\\'s Aden Protectorate in cooperation with the local Arab tribes. The Ottomans had gathered in some strength on the Cheikh Sa\\\\u00efd, a peninsula which juts out into the Red Sea towards the island of Perim.\\\\n\\\\nAt the start of the war, the British had one force stationed in the Aden Protectorate, the Aden Brigade, which was part of the British Indian Army. In November 1914, an Ottoman force from Yemen attacked Aden, but was driven off by the Brigade.\\\\n\\\\nLand campaign\\\\n\\\\nCapture of Cheikh Sa\\\\u00efd\\\\nThe 29th Indian Brigade, under Brigadier-General H. V. Cox, CB, then on its way from India to Suez, was ordered to interrupt its voyage to capture Cheikh Sa\\\\u00efd and destroy the Ottoman works, armaments, and wells there. On 10 November transports conveying three battalions of the 29th Indian Brigade and the 23rd Sikh Pioneers arrived off the coast of the peninsula. They were accompanied by the armoured cruiser HMS Duke of Edinburgh, which opened fire on the Ottoman defences while the transports were seeking a satisfactory landing-place. The point that had been at first selected proved impossible on account of the weather, and the troops had to land a little way off under the cover of the fire of the cruiser. They stormed the Ottomans\\' positions and compelled them to retreat, leaving their field guns behind. The sailors took active part in the fighting with the troops, and a naval demolition party assisted, on 11 November, in destroying the Ottoman fortifications. Having accomplished its task, the British force re-embarked and continued on to Suez. It was not considered advisable at this time to push an expedition inland. The Ottomans, consequently, retained some forces on the northern boundary of the Aden Protectorate.\\\\n\\\\nSeven months later they reoccupied Cheikh Sa\\\\u00efd and endeavoured from there to effect a landing on the north coast of Perim. This attack was successfully repulsed by the garrison of the island, the 23rd Sikh Pioneers.\\\\n\\\\nBattle of Lahij\\\\n\\\\nSultanate of Lahij\\\\nIn July 1915 an Ottoman force from North Yemen crossed the frontier of the Aden hinterland and advanced towards Lahij, which was at this time one of the most important towns in South Arabia and the capital of the Abdali Sultanate of Lahij (Lahaj). Placed in an oasis, surrounded by a fertile plain with the deserts beyond, it was the centre of trade between Aden, a British crown colony, and its hinterland, the princely states under a protectorate. In the years leading up to the war, relations between Britain and Lahij had been friendly, the British paying the sultan a subsidy for the occupation of certain land in the interior and protecting him and his agricultural people against the tribes of the desert, who frequently raided them. Propagandising during the war, British historian F. A. McKenzie wrote of the sultan:\\\\nUnder our protection the Sultan of Lahaj had waxed very prosperous. His city, with its palace, its gallows\\\\u2014 built for ornament rather than use\\\\u2014its purely Oriental life, its fine horses, its little show army, and its constant traffic in camels and caravans, seemed like a vision out of the Arabian Nights. When war broke out the Abdali Sultan proved that his loyalty to Britain was real. Though other tribes turned against us he came to our side and prepared to help us. He soon made himself an object of special detestation to the [Ottoman] and to many of the surrounding tribes by his open and unwavering friendship for Britain.\\\\n\\\\nSiege\\\\nThe sultan sent word to General D. G. L. Shaw, commanding the Aden Brigade, that the Ottomans were advancing from Mawiyah to attack him, and asked for help. General Shaw ordered the Aden Movable Column, under Lieutenant-Colonel H. E. A. Pearson, towards Lahij. The Aden Camel Troop was despatched to reconnoitre. It discovered a strong Ottoman force beyond Lahij, supported by a large number of Arab tribesmen. The Camel Troop fell back on Lahij, where it was reinforced by the advance guard of the Movable Column, numbering two hundred and fifty rifles, with two ten-pounder guns. This advance guard had moved up under most trying conditions. The heat was intense, there was great shortage of water, and progress was difficult over the sand. The main body of the Column was so delayed by difficulties of transport and by shortage of water that it did not reach Lahij at all.\\\\n\\\\nThe British in the sultan\\'s capital found themselves faced by several thousand Ottoman troops and twenty guns. In addition, Arab tribesmen had rallied by the thousand to help the Ottomans. The British were backed by the few hundred men of the sultan of Lahij\\'s native army. The Arab camp-followers of the Aden detachment deserted them in a body at the most critical hour, taking with them all their camels. Fighting opened on the evening of Sunday, 4 July. The Ottoman forces made several attacks against the British line, but each was driven off. Although after the battle the efforts of the Royal Artillery drew a tribute from General Shaw, the superior Ottoman artillery had kindled fires in different parts of Lahij, and the British were in danger of being outflanked and cut off by the Arab tribal horsemen. The sultan was killed with many of his men. When the main Aden Column never arrived, the British withdrew on 5 July with the loss of three officers wounded, but the main loss was not so much in men as in prestige.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\nIn the official report on the operations issued by the Government of India much stress was laid on \\\\\"the intense heat, sand, and shortage of water\\\\\", and \\\\\"[t]he desertion of the camel-drivers and the severe climatic conditions so delayed and distressed the main body as to necessitate a withdrawal from Lahij\\\\\". McKenzie notes that \\\\\"we do not seem to have made such arrangements for transport and for water supply as would have prepared us for the difficulties which every experienced traveller knew we would have to face. . . But the severe heat of the climate, the potential treachery of hired Arabs, and the shortage of water were all of them factors which had been familiar from the beginning to the Indian authorities, and, one might suppose, ought to have been allowed for.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nReinforcements from India\\\\n\\\\nAfter the debacle at Lahij, the British force fell back on the Kawr. The Ottomans followed them up and occupied Shaikh Othman, a town about two miles inland from the harbour of Aden. This place was formerly part of the Sultanate of Lahij, within the British protectorate. The Ottomans at this stage held practically the whole of the Aden hinterland, except immediately around the crown colony itself. They had reoccupied Cheikh Sa\\\\u00efd and had destroyed Lahij. The Indian authorities, under Commander-in-Chief Beauchamp Duff, decided to increase the Aden garrison after \\\\\"subsequent Turkish victories\\\\\". Major-General Sir George J. Younghusband, a soldier with a distinguished career, succeeded to the command of the Aden Brigade.\\\\n\\\\nOn 20 July 1915, troops from the Aden Brigade, the 28th Indian Brigade, 1/B Battery, HAC, 1/1st Berkshire Battery, RHA, and a detachment of Sappers and Miners, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel A. M. S. Elsmie, a soldier well trained in frontier fighting, surprised the Ottomans at Shaikh Othman, completely defeated them and drove them out of the place. Between fifty and sixty Ottoman soldiers were killed and wounded, and several hundred men, mostly Arab tribesmen, were made prisoners. This success was followed up in the following month by an attack by a small column on an Ottoman post between Lahij and Shaikh Othman. The Ottomans were driven from the town. Another attack in a different direction was equally successful. Reports reached Aden that the Ottomans were preparing to retire from Lahij itself, and in September a column under Colonel Elsmie set out in the direction of Waht. Here it surprised a force of seven hundred Ottomans, with eight guns, who were supported by about a thousand Arabs. The Ottomans were driven back, and Waht fell to the British troops, who had been aided both on sea and land by the cooperation of the cruiser HMS Philomel of the New Zealand Naval Forces, under Captain Percival Hill-Thompson.\\\\n\\\\nOttoman claims of victory\\\\nA series of minor engagements and skirmishes between the Ottomans and Arabs and the British followed, during which the latter were generally successful, but found it impossible to hold the country far inland. Early in 1916 the Ottomans claimed that the British had been driven back on to Aden itself, and had retreated to within range of the covering fire of their warships, where they had been inactive for some months. Many of the Ottoman claims were greatly exaggerated, and some wholly false. In February 1916, Major John Pretyman Newman, MP, asked in the British Parliament for any information about the fighting near Aden. Austen Chamberlain, then Secretary of State for India, responded that the Ottoman claim of success which had recently been put forward would seem to have been founded on an engagement which took place on 12 January between a reconnoitring column of the Aden garrison and an Ottoman force in the neighbourhood of Shaikh Othman. The loss on our side was one British officer and thirty-five Indian rank and file killed, and four British and thirty-five Indian rank and file wounded. The enemy losses were severe, amounting to about two hundred killed and wounded. The British column was neither annihilated nor defeated, but withdrew when the purpose of the movement was completed, Chamberlain said.\\\\n\\\\nLater on, the Ottomans officially claimed to have scored a substantial victory in further heavy fighting around Shaikh Othman and Bir Ahmad. This was a sheer invention. In January 1916, the Aden Movable Column moved out to protect some friendly troops to the east of the Aden Protectorate against Ottoman troops who had been sent to coerce them. The column located the Ottoman force near Subar, and defeated it. The general position was so unsatisfactory, however, that in April 1916, it was decided, on the suggestion of the Government of India, that ladies should not be allowed to land at Aden without receiving permission from the Commander-in-Chief in India.\\\\n\\\\nEnd of the campaign in South Arabia\\\\nThe eruption of the British-sponsored Arab Revolt in the Hejaz diverted Ottoman attention from Aden in the summer of 1916. Those Ottoman troops which remained reverted to the defensive, while the British built an eleven-mile-long defensive perimeter around Aden. They did not attempt to resecure lost territories in the hinterland, and no major fighting with the British took place after 1916. The Ottomans continued to hold territories in the protectorate until the Armistice of Mudros in October 1918 and the partition of the Ottoman Empire after the war.\\\\n\\\\nNaval campaign\\\\n\\\\nUses of the South Arab ports during the war\\\\nOn 18 October 1914, a convoy of ten troopships carrying the New Zealand Expeditionary Force was escorted by the Imperial Japanese battlecruiser Ibuki out of Wellington. It joined a group of twenty-eight ships carrying the First Australian Imperial Force, and the total convoy, with Ibuki and the Australian cruiser , crossed the ocean, which was being patrolled by the Japanese protected cruiser Chikuma. While Sydney was sidetracked, and ended up in the Battle of Cocos, the rest of the convoy reached Aden on 25 October.\\\\n\\\\nOn 9 November 1914, a small landing party, numbering five officers, one surgeon, and forty-seven petty officers and men, under Lieutenant Hellmuth von M\\\\u00fccke, was separated from their ship, the SMS Emden during the Battle of Cocos, and piloted the Ayesha to the Dutch port of Padang on the west coast of Sumatra. There von M\\\\u00fccke arranged a rendezvous with the German freighter Choising, which transported him and his men to the Ottoman city of Hodeida in Yemen. Once on the Arabian Peninsula, von M\\\\u00fccke and his men experienced months of delay securing the assistance of local Turkish officials to return to Germany. At last he decided to lead his men on an over-water voyage up the east coast of the Red Sea to Jiddah. Ultimately, Von M\\\\u00fccke and forty-eight of his men returned to Berlin.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the Arabs of the revolt of June 1916 attacked the port of Jiddah, they were supported by the seaplane carrier , based at Aden.\\\\n\\\\nOccupation of Kamaran\\\\nOn 17 February 1915, the British Resident in Aden, Brigadier William Crawford Walton, wired the Government of India that dhows bearing telegrams, mail and money from Jiddah had made it to Ottoman headquarters in Yemen, and that it was necessary that these be stopped. He proposed the occopuation of Kamaran with 200 men from the RMS Empress of Russia, the RMS Empress of Asia and HMS Minto. This had the support of the Admiralty, the Commander-in-Chief at Port Said\\\\u2014who wished to use Kamaran as a \\\\\"naval base for small vessels\\\\\"\\\\u2014and the India Office, which duly informed the Viceroy of India to give the necessary orders. The viceroy demurred, fearing that the local population would be \\\\\"unlikely to acquiesce\\\\\", that an occupation might \\\\\"alarm the Idrisi\\\\\", was likely to be misunderstood by Muslims, and would reduce the defences of Aden, at just the moment when the Turks were advancing. On 3 March the India Office rescinded its order, but when intelligence suggested that some Germans stranded in Massawa in Italian Eritrea at the outbreak of war were attempting to sail across the sea to Arabia, the resident renewed his request for 200 men (7 March).

       " '{\"text\": \"Enhanced catalytic activity of \\\\u03b1-FeOOH-rGO supported on active carbon fiber (ACF) for degradation of phenol and quinolone in the solar-Fenton system.\\\\nA new heterogeneous solar-Fenton catalyst, \\\\u03b1-FeOOH-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported on active carbon fiber (ACF), was synthesized via in situ electrophoretic deposition in a self-assembly process. Optimization of the components (electrophoretic deposition time of GO and Fe, GO dosages), the effect of pH and the catalysts stability were investigated systematically. The results indicated that rGO-\\\\u03b1-FeOOH composite is formed during the ferrous-ion-induced self-assembly process on ACF. FeOOH-rGO/ACF displayed excellent catalytic activity for degrading phenol and quinoline under the solar-driven photo-Fenton process in a wide range of pH values (4.5-9.5) and possess good stability in neutral condition. The phenol oxidation process on this catalyst was described by a pseudo-first-order kinetics model. Both the ACF support and solar irradiation promoted greater H2O2 decomposition and produced more OH radicals, thus, significantly improving the catalytic capacity. The introduction of graphene improved the catalytic capacity of the catalyst under solar irradiation. The optimal electrophoretic deposition time of GO and the optimal Fe and initial GO content in deposition were 10 min, 9.8 wt% and 15.0 wt%, respectively. The degradation pathways of phenol and quinoline in the solar-driven photo-Fenton process were also elucidated.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"PubMed Abstracts\"}}',\n",

       " '{\"text\": \"Irinotecan (CPT-11, Campto\\\\u00ae) -- a semisynthetic, water-soluble derivative of the plant alkaloid camptothecin -- is the standard of care in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer when 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based therapy has failed ([Cunningham *et al*, 2001](#bib5){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}). Phase II trials have demonstrated objective response rates of 16--27% in pretreated patients, with stabilisation of disease in a further 40--60% of patients ([Rougier *et al*, 1997](#bib13){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}; [Van Cutsem *et al*, 1999](#bib17){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}). Median overall survival rates of up to 10 months are achievable when irinotecan is used in relapsed/refractory colorectal cancer ([Shimada *et al*, 1993](#bib15){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}; [Rothenberg *et al*, 1996](#bib12){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}, [1999](#bib11){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}; [Pitot *et al*, 1997](#bib10){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}; [Rougier *et al*, 1997](#bib13){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}; [Van Cutsem *et al*, 1999](#bib17){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}). Two European phase III trials investigating the efficacy and safety of irinotecan, following 5-FU failure in advanced colorectal cancer, have demonstrated significant improvements in survival compared with best supportive care and 5-FU ([Cunningham *et al*, 1998](#bib6){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}; [Rougier *et al*, 1998](#bib14){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}). The main adverse events accompanying treatment with irinotecan in these trials were diarrhoea, neutropenia, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough 350\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks is the standard recommended dosage of irinotecan, pharmacokinetic parameters of irinotecan-lactone and the active metabolite SN-38-lactone vary between individuals ([Xie *et al*, 2002](#bib18){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}). This may be attributed to differences in the levels of the enzymes that metabolise irinotecan, notably carboxylesterase for SN-38. Furthermore, the variable interindividual patient exposure to SN-38 has been identified as an important determinant of toxicity ([Mathijssen *et al*, 2002](#bib8){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}).\\\\n\\\\nAt the same time, there is convincing evidence of a dose--response relationship, and therefore a rationale for increasing doses when possible. In a phase I trial by [Abigerges *et al* (1995)](#bib1){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}, there were two recommended doses: 350\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ without high-dose loperamide and 600\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ with high-dose loperamide. With the exception of one responder treated at 260\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^, all objective responses were observed at dose levels above 350\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^. [Merrouche *et al* (1997)](#bib9){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"} provided further support for this from a phase I trial in which an increased tumour response was seen at an irinotecan dose level of 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^.\\\\n\\\\nThus, these data suggest that a fixed-dose strategy for administration of irinotecan may not be optimal for all patients, thereby comprising treatment. The interindividual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters and dose--response relationship provided the rationale for investigating a dose optimisation strategy for irinotecan ([Chabot *et al*, 1995](#bib4){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}). The present study investigated different strategies, using doses of irinotecan up to 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^, as single-agent therapy in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer resistant to 5-FU.\\\\n\\\\nMETHODS\\\\n=======\\\\n\\\\nPatients\\\\n--------\\\\n\\\\nEligibility criteria included metastatic, histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum progressing on 5-FU-based chemotherapy (adjuvant and/or palliative); administration of \\\\u2a7d2 5-FU-based regimens in the adjuvant setting or \\\\u2a7d1 in the palliative setting; World Health Organization (WHO) performance status (PS) of \\\\u2a7d2; adequate haematological, renal and hepatic function. Exclusion criteria included prior treatment with topoisomerase-I inhibitors; evidence of central nervous system metastases; prior history of chronic diarrhoea; current infection; or any other serious illness or medical condition.\\\\n\\\\nStudy design and conduct\\\\n------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThis was a prospective, randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase II study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Hong Kong revision, 1989) and with the approval of the Ethics Committee (Institutional Review Board) at each participating centre. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to his or her enrolment into the trial. An independent Monitoring Committee regularly assessed the safety and efficacy issues and reviewed the conduct of the study if needed. An External Response Review Committee (ERRC) assessed tumour responses without knowledge of the randomisation arm. The aim of the study was to determine the optimal dosing strategy in terms of efficacy and safety of single-agent irinotecan (by individual dose optimisation based on patient tolerance to treatment, or optimisation based on specific baseline risk factors) in the treatment of 5-FU-resistant patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall response rate.\\\\n\\\\n### Dosing scenarios\\\\n\\\\nPatients were randomised to one of three groups (A, B and C (outlined below)), each group receiving irinotecan as a 30\\\\u2009min intravenous infusion scheduled every 21 days. This dosing interval could be extended to a maximum of 35 days in the event of persistent toxicity to allow satisfactory recovery from the previous cycle. Doses \\\\\\\\<250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ or \\\\\\\\>500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ were not used in this study; patients who exhibited significant toxicity at 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ were withdrawn from the study.\\\\n\\\\nGroup A was the reference group in which a fixed dose of 350\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ of irinotecan was administered on Day 1. In subsequent cycles, the dose of irinotecan could be decreased (but not increased) according to the presence of significant toxicity at this dose.\\\\n\\\\nGroups B and C investigated dosing scenarios to select patients for whom the higher dose of irinotecan (500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^) could be optimally used. Patients randomised to Group B received irinotecan at a starting dose of 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ followed by increasing doses (350 and 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^) depending on the tolerance observed in the preceding cycle. In the event of significant toxicity, dose reductions were implemented.\\\\n\\\\nIn Group C, the irinotecan dose was based on protocol-defined toxicity risk factors identified at baseline: grade 3--4 neutropenia (bilirubin \\\\\\\\>70% upper limit of normal (UNL), haemoglobin \\\\\\\\<12\\\\u2009g\\\\u2009dl^\\\\u22121^, \\\\\\\\>3 organs involved) and/or grade 3--4 diarrhoea (PS\\\\u2a7e1, creatinine \\\\\\\\>70% UNL ([Freyer *et al*, 2000](#bib7){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"})). Patients could be started at an irinotecan dose of 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ in the absence of toxicity risk factors. The starting dose of irinotecan was 350\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ in patients with one risk factor or one factor from each group, and 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ for patients with \\\\\\\\>2 risk factors or two factors from the same group. The dose was not escalated, but could be reduced to 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ in the event of significant treatment-emergent toxicity.\\\\n\\\\nConcomitant treatments and follow-up\\\\n------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nAntiemetic drugs were administered as premedication to irinotecan infusions. Atropine was permitted for acute anticholinergic symptoms and loperamide (or similar) for delayed diarrhoea. In addition, preventative oral antibiotic therapy (e.g. an oral fluoroquinolone) was administered to patients with persistent (\\\\\\\\>48\\\\u2009h) grade 4 diarrhoea or for diarrhoea associated with grade 3--4 neutropenia or fever. No granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support was allowed. All patients were followed until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death occurred, or the patient chose to withdraw from the trial. In all cases, in each group where toxicity necessitated a dose reduction, delay or study treatment termination, the patient was followed up until the event had resolved.\\\\n\\\\nEfficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic evaluations\\\\n------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nTumour response rate, the primary efficacy end point, was measured according to WHO criteria and evaluated by the ERRC. Response was defined as complete (CR) plus partial (PR) response and as tumour growth control in terms of stabilisation of disease (PR plus no change/stable disease). Secondary efficacy variables were the duration of response and disease stabilisation, time to progression (TTP), time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival. The duration of response was measured from the first day of infusion of irinotecan to the first date that disease progression was noted or to the date of death for any reason. Time to progression was calculated from the date of randomisation to the first documented date of progression or the date of death for any reason. Time to treatment failure was the period between the date of randomisation and the date of tumour progression or treatment discontinuation for any reason. Survival was defined as the time between randomisation and death. Efficacy evaluations were performed using intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (eligible and evaluable) patient populations.\\\\n\\\\nThe safety population comprised all patients who had started at least one infusion of study treatment. Safety was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria or, if this was not applicable, graded as mild, moderate, severe or life threatening. The safety analysis was based on the worst grade by patient and by cycle. Deaths during the trial and up to 30 days from the last infusion were recorded.\\\\n\\\\nPharmacokinetic evaluations were performed using a population approach ([Chabot *et al*, 1995](#bib4){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}; [Canal *et al*, 1996](#bib3){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}). At 30\\\\u2009min prior to infusion, and at 5\\\\u2009min and 3--4\\\\u2009h postinfusion (an additional sample was collected at 24\\\\u2009h postinfusion in some cases), three 5\\\\u2009ml blood samples (plus one predrug sample) were taken for analysis at the first cycle of chemotherapy for Groups A and C, and at the first, second and third cycles for Group B. Plasma levels of irinotecan and SN-38 were measured using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with camptothecin as an internal standard. Peak plasma concentration (*C*~max~) and the area under the plasma concentration--time curve (AUC) were calculated for both irinotecan and SN-38. In addition, total body clearance was calculated for irinotecan, and the time to reach *C*~max~ (*t*~max~) as well as the AUC normalised to l mg of irinotecan (AUC~N~) were calculated for SN-38. A three- and two-compartment model was used for irinotecan and SN-38, respectively.\\\\n\\\\nStatistical considerations\\\\n--------------------------\\\\n\\\\nUsing the hypothesis that the response rate in Groups B and C would be 20%, a total of 64 patients in each of these groups were required to yield a confidence interval (CI) band of \\\\u2a7d20%. For the reference group (Group A), the number of subjects randomised was half that of Groups B and C. The 95% CIs were estimated for response, using the exact method. Confidence intervals on median values were estimated using the method described by Brookmeyer and Crowley ([Simon *et al*, 1985](#bib16){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}). Descriptive statistics only were used for the pharmacokinetic parameters in each group.\\\\n\\\\nRESULTS\\\\n=======\\\\n\\\\nPatients\\\\n--------\\\\n\\\\nA total of 164 patients entered the study: 36 in Group A, 62 in Group B and 66 in Group C ([Table 1](#tbl1){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). The majority of patients (\\\\u2a7e97%) had received surgery and 20--30% had received radiotherapy and/or prior adjuvant chemotherapy. Based on the assessment of baseline risk factors previously described, 23 (35%) patients in Group C were assigned to receive a starting dose of 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ irinotecan, 37 (56%) patients to 350\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ and six (9%) patients to 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^.\\\\n\\\\nA total of 144 (88%) patients (31, 51 and 62 in Groups A, B and C, respectively) were eligible and evaluable for the efficacy analyses. Nine patients were ineligible due to major protocol violations (\\\\\\\\>1 line of palliative chemotherapy, and past or concurrent history of neoplasm other than colorectal adenocarcinoma in one patient) and 12 patients (not mutually exclusive) were nonevaluable for response. Early discontinuation because of adverse events rendered eight patients nonevaluable.\\\\n\\\\nExtent of exposure to irinotecan\\\\n--------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe median dose intensity of irinotecan was similar in the three arms: 114.21\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^\\\\u2009week^\\\\u22121^ (95% CI 76.14--119.21) in Group A, 101.36\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^\\\\u2009week^\\\\u22121^ (95% CI 68.22--158.17) in Group B and 106.69\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^\\\\u2009week^\\\\u22121^ (95% CI 67.11--170.93) in Group C. However, the median cumulative dose was higher in Group A (1948.80\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^) than in Groups B (1564.26\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^) and C (1326.77\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^), possibly due to the longer median treatment time in this group (18 weeks, compared with 16 and 13 weeks in Groups B and C, respectively).\\\\n\\\\nThe percentage of cycles delivered at doses of 250, 350 and 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ were as follows: 3, 92 and 0% (as this was not an option) in Group A; 41, 30 and 27% in Group B; and 33, 51 and 8% in Group C. A few cycles in each group were given at intermediate doses or at doses above 525\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^.\\\\n\\\\nIn Group B, the only dose escalation option, 63% of patients had at least one dose escalation from the 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ start dose.\\\\n\\\\nMore than 80% of patients in each group did not require dose reduction. A total of 36--40% of patients experienced a cycle delay ([Table 2](#tbl2){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). Although the majority of dose reductions in each group were made for treatment-related reasons (mostly nonhaematological adverse events across all arms), the majority of cycle delays occurred for reasons unrelated to treatment.\\\\n\\\\nEfficacy\\\\n--------\\\\n\\\\n### Response rate\\\\n\\\\nIn the total (ITT) patient population (*n*=164), the overall response rates were 8, 13 and 9% in Groups A, B and C, respectively ([Table 3](#tbl3){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). There were no CRs. Tumour growth control rates were higher in Groups A and B and the rates of progressive disease were lower, compared with Group C ([Table 3](#tbl3){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). The pattern of response across the groups was maintained in the per-protocol (eligible and evaluable) patient population (*n*=144), with overall response rates (no CR) of 10, 16 and 10% in Groups A, B and C, respectively. Corresponding tumour growth control rates were 61, 65 and 53%.\\\\n\\\\nResponses occurred at all dose levels ([Table 3](#tbl3){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). However, there were only two responses at the 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ dose of irinotecan, both in Group C. Although it is difficult to interpret the data based on the small patient numbers in this study, they suggest that starting patients on a dose of 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ was not beneficial.\\\\n\\\\nThe median duration of response and TTP were significantly longer in Groups A and B compared with Group C (*P*=0.030) ([Table 3](#tbl3){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). Despite a trend towards a shorter TTF and median overall survival in Group C, there were no significant differences across the arms for these parameters.\\\\n\\\\nSafety and tolerability\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nAll patients were evaluable for safety. At least one adverse event was reported in all patients. However, grade 3--4 adverse events possibly or probably related to the study treatment were reported in less than half of the patients in each group ([Table 4](#tbl4){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). Most of these were related to haematological or gastrointestinal (GI) events ([Table 4](#tbl4){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). Grade 3--4 neutropenia with fever or infection was infrequent. Although anaemia was common, it was infrequently reported at grade 3--4 level of severity ([Table 4](#tbl4){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). Diarrhoea was the most common GI event, occurring in 85% of patients, although grade 3--4 diarrhoea was less frequent (31, 21 and 27% in Groups A, B and C, respectively) ([Table 4](#tbl4){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). There were no significant between-group differences for any of the adverse events reported. In addition, analysis of adverse events at the different dose levels showed no consistent evidence that toxicity increased with increasing dosage. There was no difference between the three treatment groups for the number of patients reporting \\\\u2a7e1 grade 3--4 adverse event considered to be possibly or probably treatment-related (Group A, 42%; Group B, 48%; Group C, 49%). Overall, 74 serious adverse events considered possibly or probably related to study medication occurred in 39 patients.\\\\n\\\\nTreatment discontinuations\\\\n--------------------------\\\\n\\\\nAt the designated study end date, 159 (96.95%). patients had discontinued treatment (Group A, 97%; Group B, 95%; Group C, 99%) ([Table 5](#tbl5){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). Disease progression resulted in proportionately fewer discontinuations in Group B (57%) than in Groups A (72%) and C (80%), and included fatalities arising from progressive disease (one patient in each of Groups A and B, and two patients in Group C). There was also one fatality: a case of aspiration pneumonia secondary to vomiting in a patient in Group B receiving the first cycle of irinotecan 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^. Five (42%) of the patients who discontinued treatment from Group B were receiving the 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ dose option during cycle 1 at the time of withdrawal. Adverse events leading to discontinuations are listed in [Table 5](#tbl5){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}.\\\\n\\\\nPharmacokinetic parameters\\\\n--------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe principal pharmacokinetic parameters for irinotecan and SN-38 measured in 29 assessable patients are presented in [Table 6](#tbl6){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}. The mean total body clearance values of irinotecan were similar across all three groups and no relevant differences in dose-normalised exposure were seen. Exposure to irinotecan and SN-38 increased proportionally over the 250--500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ irinotecan dose range. In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, exposure to irinotecan appeared to be increased in patients with PS 1 or 2, and in patients with high alkaline phosphate levels.\\\\n\\\\nDISCUSSION\\\\n==========\\\\n\\\\nThe results of this phase II study confirm the activity of single-agent irinotecan in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed previous therapy with 5-FU. All three treatment strategies investigated were active and demonstrated acceptable tolerability patterns. Although almost all patients in the study had \\\\u2a7e1 adverse event, less than half of the patients in each treatment strategy had grade 3--4 toxicity.\\\\n\\\\nThe main aim of this study was to determine the optimal irinotecan dosing regimen for the treatment of this population, with the primary end point being response rate. The highest overall response rate was seen in patients in Group B (13%). In this group, four (21%) of the 19 patients receiving irinotecan 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ achieved a response. There was little difference in the overall response rates in Groups A and C (8 and 9%, respectively). An interesting observation in this study was the relatively higher rate of progressive disease in Group C (44%) compared with Groups A and B (36 and 31%). None of the differences in response rate between the groups were statistically significant. It is worth mentioning that the response rate observed in Group A was unusually low, and less than that seen in published studies of similar populations of patients treated with the same schedule ([Rougier *et al*, 1997](#bib13){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}; [Van Cutsem *et al*, 1999](#bib17){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}). This may be due to changes in first-line treatment that have occurred in recent years; compared with patients treated in earlier studies, those in the present study may have been more heavily pretreated with 5-FU and oxaliplatin in the first-line setting, thus making them more chemotherapy resistant. Despite the lower response rate in Group A, it is within the CIs of previous studies and so can be considered representative.\\\\n\\\\nThe lack of a significant difference in overall response rates between the groups may reflect the fact that the median dose intensity of irinotecan delivered was relatively constant across the three groups, despite a proportion of patients in Groups B (34%) and C (9%) receiving an irinotecan dose of 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^. This finding is probably due mainly to the fact that a disproportionate number of patients (more than one-third) in each of Groups B and C never received a dose of more than 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^, and so were possibly underdosed. The likelihood of underdosing in Groups B and C is supported by the observation that only 6% of patients in Group A required dose reduction from 350 to 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^.\\\\n\\\\nThere were no significant differences between Groups A and B in TTP or overall survival. This may be due to an insufficient powering of the study and/or too small a difference in response rates. A previous meta-analysis conducted in patients with advanced colorectal cancer reported that only large differences in response rate correspond to a significant difference in TTP ([Buyse *et al*, 2000](#bib2){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}). Both TTP and duration of response were significantly shorter in Group C than in Groups A and B, and there was also a trend for a shorter overall survival in this group. The relatively poor efficacy seen in Group C may have been due to a combination of underdosing (i.e. a significant number of patients receiving irinotecan 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^) and the small number of patients who received the high dose of irinotecan (500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^) (six patients or 9%).\\\\n\\\\nThere was a trend towards a better safety profile in Group B. Grade 3--4 neutropenia was 31% in Group B, 47% in A and 44% in Group B. Similarly, there was less grade 3--4 diarrhoea in Group B as compared with Groups A and C (21 *vs* 31 and 27%, respectively), despite 34% of patients receiving the highest irinotecan dose. We cannot exclude the contribution to this difference of imbalances in gender ratio (more male patients in Group B) and PS (more patients with PS=0 in Group B). However, it is possible that the results reflect the aim of the strategy adopted in Group B, which was to avoid subjecting patients to higher doses than they were able to tolerate. Indeed 10 out of 12 patients in Group B who withdrew from the study due to treatment-related adverse events received the lowest dose of irinotecan (250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^) and therefore would not have tolerated an increased dose of irinotecan. However, it should also be noted that severe toxicity leading to treatment discontinuation occurred more frequently in Group B despite the low dose given to all patients in the first cycle. In Group C, despite the strategy of basing the initial irinotecan dose on predetermined risk factors, patients administered the 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ dose demonstrated higher rates of grade 3--4 anaemia and diarrhoea compared with those receiving the 350 and 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ doses.\\\\n\\\\nThis study demonstrates that intrapatient dose escalation based on toxicity in the preceding cycle dose, as practised in Group B, is feasible. Although the increase in the response rate over the whole group was modest compared with the standard irinotecan dose, clinical benefit may be seen in those patients who are able to receive 350 and 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^, which, in this study, was associated with a response rate of 25 and 21%, respectively. The findings of our study in pretreated patients are in agreement with those of a nonrandomised study in previously untreated patients ([Ychou *et al*, 2002](#bib19){ref-type=\\\\\"other\\\\\"}): the greater proportion of patients who are able to receive the higher dose and the higher response rate achieved in the latter study compared with our study is probably a reflection of interstudy differences in the starting dose, dose escalation guidelines and in the study population (previous treatment compared with no previous treatment).\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast with the feasibility of the strategy in Group B, the use of dose optimisation according to the baseline risk characteristics identified in our study protocol (as practised in Group C) appeared not to be an appropriate approach. This may be because the risk characteristics identified were not valid in this setting or that the algorithm for dose assignment was not relevant. Further investigation is required to clarify this.\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, the data from our randomised phase II study suggest that individual dose optimisation based on toxicity in the preceding cycle is feasible and merits further investigation. Increasing the dose of irinotecan to 500\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ can be of benefit in selected patients. It will be necessary to identify the most appropriate starting dose, as the dose of 250\\\\u2009mg\\\\u2009m^\\\\u22122^ used in this study was possibly too conservative. Data from pharmacogenomic research are likely to be useful in the future for identifying the most appropriate starting dose of irinotecan for individual patients.\\\\n\\\\nThe following additional

Its position can be derived from inputs provided by one or multiple sensory modalities such as vision, audition or somatosensation. Multisensory integration is referred to as the combination of information arising from different sensory modalities to form a unified and coherent representation of our environment and body. Accordingly, the brain combines all the relevant sensory information about the object of interest in order to decrease the variance (the uncertainty) and build a more reliable representation of that object \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref001],[@pone.0199627.ref002]\\\\\\\\]. Indeed, it has been shown that spatial localization was less variable for visual-auditory targets than for targets specified by vision or audition only \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref003],[@pone.0199627.ref004]\\\\\\\\]. These findings suggest that the more sensory information available about the target, the more accurate its estimate.\\\\n\\\\nWhen pointing to unseen parts of our own body (e.g. the opposite index finger), the position of the target is derived from proprioceptive signals. Proprioception corresponds to the sense of our body position in space. Consistent with the principles of multisensory integration, it has been found that participants better matched the position of their index finger when they could see their opposite arm during movement than when being blindfolded during the task \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref005],[@pone.0199627.ref006]\\\\\\\\]. The localization of the fingertip was more precise in the presence of both vision and proprioception than when using visual or proprioceptive signals only. These results provide evidence that fingertip localization can be more precise if another sensory modality, in addition to proprioception, provides further information about the finger position.\\\\n\\\\nUnlike vision, touch may not provide additional information about finger position in space, since fingertip tactile information theoretically remains the same irrespective of the postural configuration of the upper limb. However, touch can be regarded as a possible source of additional information for position sense, since touch and proprioception, although considered as separate modalities, have been shown to closely interact with each other. Behavioral studies have shown that tactile perception can be modulated by changes in proprioceptive signals, induced by active changes in hand posture \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref007]\\\\\\\\] or tendon vibration \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref008]\\\\\\\\]. Conversely, a finger-position matching task has been reported to be affected by nerve block and cutaneous anesthesia \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref009]\\\\\\\\], indicating that cutaneous afferents may provide a crude position sense for the fingers. Moreover, it has been shown that the localization of a proprioceptive target (i.e., the fingertip) was improved when participants contacted a surface with their target fingertip, which provides them with tactile feedback \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref010]--[@pone.0199627.ref012]\\\\\\\\]. Similarly, accuracy in pointing movements was enhanced when endpoint contact occurred with the effector fingertip \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref013]\\\\\\\\]. In contrast, digital anesthesia resulted in impaired fingertip localization \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref011]\\\\\\\\] as well as decreased movement accuracy during typing \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref014]\\\\\\\\]. This relationship between touch and proprioception is likely to be explained by the convergence of proprioceptive and tactile signals at the cortical level; electrophysiological recordings in monkey have shown that neurons in the hand representation of the primary somatosensory cortex code both tactile and proprioceptive modalities during a reach-to-grasp task \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref012],[@pone.0199627.ref015]\\\\\\\\]. It has also been established that neurons in the somatosensory cortex have both cutaneous and proprioceptive receptive fields \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref016],[@pone.0199627.ref017]\\\\\\\\]. Taken together, these findings suggest that tactile afferent information may contribute to proprioception and improve the accuracy of the hand proprioceptive estimate.\\\\n\\\\nThe skin contains several mechanoreceptors, including Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles. Meissner corpuscles are located in the superficial layers of the skin and are sensitive to light touch while Pacinian corpuscles are found in deeper layers and respond to deep skin pressure and vibration. The properties of these two receptors suggest that they might be activated by fingertip contact; Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles are fastadapting receptors which are both sensitive to abrupt but not sustained stimuli \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref018]\\\\\\\\], such as when a finger makes or breaks contact with an object. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the relative contributions of Pacinian and Meissner corpuscules to the enhancement of proprioception following fingertip contact with a surface \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref010]--[@pone.0199627.ref013]\\\\\\\\]. However, these two types of mechanoreceptors show different responses to cutaneous vibrations. Meissner corpuscles respond to low frequencies, 10--80 Hz, whereas Pacinian corpuscles are sensitive to vibrations at higher frequencies, 80--450 Hz \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref019]\\\\\\\\]. Consequently, by stimulating either of these receptors, it would be possible to know which one contributes to the enhancement of proprioceptive localization.\\\\n\\\\nIt has been shown that the ability to detect flexion and extension movements imposed at the interphalangeal joints of a finger was impaired when 300 Hz vibrations were applied to the adjacent or the test digit. In contrast, vibrotactile stimuli at 30 Hz did not alter proprioception in the finger \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref020],[@pone.0199627.ref021]\\\\\\\\]. The detection of passive finger movements at the interphalangeal joints is thus impaired by the specific activation of Pacinian, but not Meissner, afferents. These results demonstrate that vibrotactile stimulation can modulate proprioceptive acuity in a passive perceptual task, in which no action is involved. However, to our knowledge this has not been tested in a motor task, such as reaching, where the target location corresponds to the position of the fingertip.\\\\n\\\\nThe goal of the present study was to investigate the influence of vibrotactile information on the proprioceptive localization of the finger in a motor context. To this purpose, we asked participants to perform reaches to proprioceptively defined targets. They reached with the right index finger (reaching finger) to the unseen left index finger (target finger), which was passively displaced to different locations. Tactile vibrations at 30 or 300 Hz were delivered to the target index fingertip prior to movement onset. When vibrations are applied, the left index finger receives tactile information, in addition to existing proprioceptive information, about its location in space. In order to reach accurately, we presume that the brain constructs a reliable estimate of the target finger position using all the sensory information available. As suggested by previous studies \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref019]-- [@pone.0199627.ref021]\\\\\\\\], high- and low-frequency vibrations are more likely to activate Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles, respectively. We thus used 30 and 300 Hz vibrotactile stimulations to determine if one of these two mechanoreceptors contribute more than the other to touch-proprioception integration, or whether they both contribute to finger proprioceptive localization. We measured reach endpoint accuracy and precision to assess the effect of vibrations. We found that vibrotactile stimulations delivered at low and high frequencies improved both accuracy and precision of finger localization in a proprioceptive reaching task. A control condition in which the vibration was applied elsewhere on the body showed that this improvement in proprioceptive localization cannot be attributed to a global arousal enhancement induced by the tactile stimulus.\\\\n\\\\nMethods {#sec002}\\\\n=======\\\\n\\\\nParticipants {#sec003}\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\nNineteen participants took part in this study (12 females, mean \\\\u00b1 SD age = 25.3 \\\\u00b1 10.7 years). They were all right-handed, as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory and all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Participants were administered a questionnaire to ensure that they did not suffer from neurological, sensory or motor deficits, which may have interfered with their performance. All gave informed written consent to participate in this experiment which conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki (2008) for experiments on human subjects. All experimental procedures were approved by the health research ethics committee in France (CPP Nord-Ouest I, Lyon, 2017-A02562-51) and at the University of Montreal (17-034-CERES-D).\\\\n\\\\nApparatus {#sec004}\\\\n---------\\\\n\\\\nParticipants sat in a dark room on a height-adjustable chair in front of a slanted table. Their head was held steady on a chin rest, aligned with their body midline. A wide-screen OLED monitor (55 inches diagonal, 1920 x 1080 pixels, LG) was placed facing downwards above the table and a half-reflecting mirror was positioned in between the screen and the table so that the screen was projected onto the tabletop surface. The half-reflecting mirror prevented participants from seeing their hands unless there was light underneath the mirror; in that case vision of the hand was possible. Participants performed a proprioceptive pointing task. They were asked to reach with the right index finger (reaching finger) to the unseen left index finger (target finger). Participants\\' left forearm was resting on a platform in such a way that when the left index finger was aligned with the body midline, the elbow was located on average 17.5 cm on the left relative to the center ([Fig 1A](#pone.0199627.g001){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). The left forearm was positioned at an angle of 47\\\\u00b0. The forearm platform was motorized and could move laterally (left or right) to different target positions. The target locations for the left index finger were at -10, -5, 0, +5 and +10 cm with respect to the body midline. A tactor was positioned on the left index fingertip and connected to an amplifier (TactAmp 4.2, Dancer Design, England, United Kingdom) that delivered tactile vibrations at a frequency of either 30 or 300 Hz. Eye movements were monitored using an EyeLink 1000 Plus (SR Research, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The positions of both left and right index fingers were measured using an Optotrak 3D Investigator recording system (NDI, Waterloo, Canada). This system recorded the position of two infrared emitting diodes, each one attached to the tip of each index finger. The movement of the infrared markers was tracked and sampled at a rate of 500 Hz.\\\\n\\\\n![Schematic of the apparatus, top view (A) and sequence of a trial (B).\\\\\\\\\\\\n(A) Participants\\' left forearm was resting on a motorized platform that could move laterally to the five proprioceptive target positions (grey circles). The left forearm was positioned at an angle of 47\\\\u00b0 approximately. When the left index finger was aligned with the central target, the left elbow was 17.5 cm left relative to the body midline. The start position (white circle) for the right index finger was 15 cm ahead of the participants\\' torso. The fixation cross (black cross) was located further than the proprioceptive target positions. (B) The hang light and the start position were first turned on for 1500 ms and participants were asked to align their right index finger with the start position. Then, the fixation cross appeared and participants maintained gaze on the cross until the end of the trial. After 2000 ms, the platform started moving the left target hand for a variable amount of time (between 2 and 9 s). Afterwards, a tactile vibration was delivered to the left index finger for 1000 ms. Then a first auditory tone served as a \\\\\"go\\\\\" signal for participants to start reaching with their right index finger towards their left index fingertip. After 2000 ms, a second auditory tone was presented and participants put their right index finger back to the start position. The next trial started 750 ms later.](pone.0199627.g001){#pone.0199627.g001}\\\\n\\\\nProcedure {#sec005}\\\\n---------\\\\n\\\\nThe sequence of a trial is depicted in [Fig 1B](#pone.0199627.g001){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}. At the beginning of each trial, a light was switched on for 1500 ms so that participants could see their hands. At the same time, a red dot aligned with the body midline and 15 cm distant from the torso was displayed also for 1500 ms. The red dot served as a start position and participants were asked to align their right index fingertip with the red dot and to keep it in this position until they began reaching. They kept their right fingertip balanced in the air above the table (no surface contact). As soon as the start position disappeared, a white fixation cross was displayed and participants were required to fixate the cross until the end of the trial. The fixation cross was aligned with the body midline above the target positions. After two seconds, the motorized platform moved the left target index finger to one of the 5 possible target locations. To prevent participants from learning proprioceptive target positions across trials, the platform made several back-and-forth movements (from 1 to 5) before stopping on a target location. Then, a vibrotactile stimulation was applied to the left target index fingertip for 1000 ms. Vibrations could be delivered at 0 (no vibration condition), 30 or 300 Hz. After the tactile stimulation, a first auditory tone signaled to the participants that they could begin reaching with their right hand. Participants had 2 s to complete their reach before a second auditory tone instructed them to return to the start position. Participants were instructed to reach to a location just above their left fingertip, pause in the air, then return to the start position. Specifically, participants were asked to reach to where they thought their left index fingertip was as accurately as possible and to avoid contacting their left target index finger with their right hand. To ensure that participants performed the task properly, they first did a practice block and were asked to report when finger-finger contact occurred during the experiment. The next trial began after 750 ms.\\\\n\\\\nEach block was composed of 15 trials (3 vibration frequencies x 5 target positions). Each of the possible combinations of target and vibration frequency was presented in a random order. Each participant completed between 10 and 20 blocks to obtain at least 4 trials for each combination of target and vibration frequency.\\\\n\\\\nTo test for a possible effect of the fingertip vibration by arousal enhancement, participants performed 2 additional control blocks in which the location of the vibrotactile stimulus was varied. The trials were identical to those in the main experiment except that the vibration was delivered to the left shoulder. The order of the blocks (control and main experiments) was counterbalanced across participants.\\\\n\\\\nData analysis {#sec006}\\\\n-------------\\\\n\\\\nIn this proprioceptive reaching task, errors were defined as the difference between the positions of the left (target) index finger and the right (reaching) index finger at the end of the movement. Since the position of the target hand was varied in the horizontal axis, we only considered reaching errors in the *x*-direction. Errors in the *x*-direction were computed for each trial by subtracting the *x*-position of the target hand from the *x*position of the right-hand endpoint. The constant *x*-error was expressed in mm and corresponded to the mean error in the *x*-direction for each target; this measure provides an estimate of the accuracy of the localization of the fingertip position. We used dispersion error as a measure of reach precision \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref022]\\\\\\\\]. The dispersion error corresponded to the surface area of the endpoints around each corresponding target, it was expressed in mm^2^ and computed with the following formula: SD~x~ \\\\u00d7 SD~y~ \\\\u00d7 \\\\u03c0. With SD~x~ and SD~y~ corresponding to the standard deviations of reach endpoints in the x- and y-direction, respectively. Dispersion error provides an estimate of the precision of the localization of the fingertip position. Constant *x*-errors and dispersion errors were first calculated for each participant, vibration condition and target position, then averaged across target positions and participants. To test the influence of the vibration frequency on constant *x*errors and dispersion errors, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed for each type of error separately. Similarly, one-way repeated measures ANOVAs were performed on constant x-errors and dispersion errors for each of the two attention control experiments. Tukey HSD tests were used for post-hoc comparisons of the means.\\\\n\\\\nThe threshold for statistical significance was set at 0.05 for all analyses.\\\\n\\\\nResults {#sec007}\\\\n=======\\\\n\\\\nReach endpoints relative to the five possible proprioceptive target locations are depicted in [Fig 2](#pone.0199627.g002){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"} for one participant. Endpoints are represented for all three experimental conditions: the no vibration condition, the 30 Hz and the 300 Hz vibration conditions (in red, green and blue, respectively). The one-standard-deviation ellipses correspond to the dispersion of reach endpoints and the center of ellipses represents the mean reach error. For this participant, reach endpoints were overall more scattered when no tactile stimulus was delivered to the target index fingertip (in red) compared to the 30 Hz and the 300 Hz vibration conditions (in green and blue).\\\\n\\\\n![Reach endpoints for one participant.\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe participant reached in the dark with his right hand towards his unseen left target index finger under three conditions.

It could be due to an effect of the vibration by arousal enhancement. To test for this, we investigated whether constant *x*-errors and dispersion errors changed when the vibration was delivered elsewhere. Thus, participants performed a control experiment where the vibrotactile stimulus was applied to the left shoulder. If reduced errors consecutive to the vibration of the left fingertip result from an effect of arousal, they should also be observed in this control condition. If they rather result from a specific spatial multi-sensory integration, then stimulation on the shoulder should not improve constant or dispersion errors compared to the no vibration condition.\\\\n\\\\nThe constant *x*-errors and the dispersion errors when the vibration was applied on the left shoulder are shown in [Fig 5A and 5B](#pone.0199627.g005){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}, respectively.

For instance, accurate reaching movements require precise target localization prior to motor execution and several studies have shown that this localization was better when more than one sensory modality provided information about the target position \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref003],[@pone.0199627.ref004],[@pone.0199627.ref024]\\\\\\\\]. When pointing to our body parts (e.g. the opposite index finger), the target is proprioceptively defined and reaches tend to be more variable than those directed to visual targets \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref025]\\\\\\\\]. This might be related to a greater uncertainty in the localization of proprioceptive versus visual targets \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref026]\\\\\\\\]. Hence, proprioceptive reaching might be improved if a second sensory modality provides additional information about the spatial location of the target. The interaction between touch and proprioception that has been reported in previous studies \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref007]--[@pone.0199627.ref009]\\\\\\\\] suggests that tactile information could be used as a second source of sensory information to improve the localization of a proprioceptive target.\\\\n\\\\nThe goal of this study was to investigate the influence of tactile information on the proprioceptive localization of the index finger in a motor context. In order to do so, we had participants perform a position-matching task in which they were asked to make reaches with the right index finger to a proprioceptive target (i.e., the opposite left index finger). No visual feedback of the hand was provided during reach execution and 30 or 300 Hz vibrotactile stimulations were applied on the left target index fingertip prior to movement onset. Trials in which no tactile vibration was delivered to the left index finger were also included. Constant *x*-errors and dispersion errors were measured and compared across all three experimental conditions. Constant *x*-errors represent the reach accuracy, that is to say how close the right reaching finger is from the left target finger; the smaller the constant *x*-error, the greater the reach accuracy. Dispersion errors refer to reach precision which reflect how consistent reach endpoints are when repeated; the smaller the dispersion error, the greater the reach precision.\\\\n\\\\nWe found that reach accuracy and precision, measured as constant and dispersion errors respectively, were both affected by the application of vibrotactile stimulations on the left target index fingertip. Indeed, both the constant and the dispersion errors were reduced when 30 or 300 Hz vibrations were delivered, as compared to the no vibration condition. Thus, it seems that cutaneous vibrations at either low or high frequencies provided the nervous system with additional (though slightly different) tactile information about the left index finger position. As a result, the spatial localization of the proprioceptive target was enhanced and both the accuracy and the precision of reaching were improved relative to the condition with no tactile stimulation. These results suggest that tactile information from the cutaneous vibrations is integrated with proprioceptive information about the position of the target index finger. In accordance with multisensory integration principles, the congruent proprioceptive and tactile information enhanced the finger proprioceptive localization, and ultimately improved proprioceptive reach performance.\\\\n\\\\nThe finding that both 30 and 300 Hz vibrotactile stimulations similarly improve reaching performance does not allow us to conclude about the specific contributions of Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles to touch-proprioceptive integration. According to previous studies, low- and high-frequency cutaneous vibrations appear to have distinct effects on proprioceptive acuity \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref020],[@pone.0199627.ref021]\\\\\\\\]. Performance in a passive finger movement detection task was impaired when stimulations at 300 Hz were delivered to the finger. In contrast, the application of 30 Hz vibrations did not alter task performance. However, in our study we found similar results when either 30 or 300 Hz vibrotactile stimulation was applied to the proprioceptive target of the reach (i.e., the left index finger). Both high- and low-frequency tactile stimulations led to an improvement in reach accuracy and precision when pointing to the left index finger. These discrepancies might be explained by the fact that the tasks used in these studies were fundamentally different. Participants in Weerakkody\\'s studies \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref020],[@pone.0199627.ref021]\\\\\\\\] performed a perceptual task in which they reported whether the movement imposed to their finger was a flexion or an extension. In contrast, in our study, participants were asked to localize a proprioceptive target and match its position by reaching with the opposite index finger. It has been proposed that somatosensory, and thus proprioceptive and tactile information is processed differently for perception and for action \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref027]\\\\\\\\]. Similar to the two cortical processing streams described in the visual system \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref028]\\\\\\\\], the \\\\\"ventral\\\\\" pathway is concerned with conscious somatosensory perception and object recognition while the \\\\\"dorsal\\\\\" pathway is relevant for guidance of action. The functional dissociation between the two somatosensory pathways has been established by studies in brain-damaged patients showing that they could perform motor actions towards somatosensory targets which were not consciously perceived \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref029]--[@pone.0199627.ref031]\\\\\\\\]. These two separate somatosensory streams might explain why vibrotactile information is processed differently in perceptual and motor tasks. Nevertheless, it has been reported that separating the different tactile afferent fibers is challenging. It does not only depend on the stimulus frequency, but also on other parameters such as skin temperature \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref032]\\\\\\\\]. Moreover, Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles are likely to have partially overlapping sensitivities, and thus detection thresholds which are relatively close to each other \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref019],[@pone.0199627.ref032],[@pone.0199627.ref033]\\\\\\\\]. In the present study, it is therefore possible that the two vibrotactile frequencies delivered to the left target index finger might have activated both Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles. That could also explain why we did not observe difference between the 30 and 300 Hz vibration conditions.\\\\n\\\\nIn the present study, we found that tactile information provided on fingertip was integrated with proprioception, resulting in an improved spatial localization of the target fingertip during proprioceptive reaching. It could be that this improvement in spatial localization produced by the tactile stimuli was due to arousal enhancement related to the presence of an additional signal (i.e., the vibration). However, we found in a control experiment that putting the same vibration on the left shoulder did not improve reach precision (dispersion errors) as it did when the finger was vibrated, and while it produced changes to reach accuracy (constant *x*-errors), these were in the opposite manner as expected. Indeed, there was a decrease in accuracy rather than an increase as would be expected by increased arousal. Furthermore this effect was not consistent across the two vibration frequencies. Alternatively, enhanced spatial localization of the left target finger following vibrotactile stimuli could be explained by spatial attentional cueing effects. The vibration would act as a cue driving attention to the left index finger. If this was the case, a cue from another sensory modality (e.g. audition) delivered nearby the hand should improve fingertip localization as well. We believe that this is unlikely to account for our results since it has recently been shown that auditory cueing does not modulate hand localization accuracy \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref034]\\\\\\\\]. Thus, we can rule out arousal and spatial attentional cueing effects.\\\\n\\\\nOur effect results from a specific spatial integration of tactile and proprioceptive information. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this multisensory integration remain to be determined. According to the classic view of somatosensory processing, although both ascending through the dorsal column-medial lemniscal pathway, tactile and proprioceptive inputs remain segregated and are transmitted to distinct areas of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref035]\\\\\\\\]. Somatosensory signals are not merged together until they reach higher-order somatosensory areas, such as the posterior parietal cortex. This integration is thought to be mediated by area 5 in the intraparietal cortex, where both tactile and proprioceptive inputs converge \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref036]\\\\\\\\]. However, electrophysiological recordings (mainly in areas 3b, 1 and 2) have provided evidence that some neurons in S1 respond to both tactile and proprioceptive signals \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref016],[@pone.0199627.ref017],[@pone.0199627.ref037]\\\\\\\\]. These findings support an alternative but not exclusive hypothesis that multimodal interaction, and thus integration, between touch and proprioception might also occur at the level of S1, presumably in all sub-areas. Indeed, about half of S1 neurons, located in multimodal areas 1 and 2 but also in the previously thought modality-specific areas 3a (proprioception) and 3b (cutaneous), showed responses to both proprioceptive and tactile stimuli \\\\\\\\[[@pone.0199627.ref038]\\\\\\\\]. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning touch-proprioceptive integration and determine how tactile inputs influence the processing of proprioceptive information.\\\\n\\\\nThe authors would like to thank Romain Fournet for technical assistance.\\\\n\\\\n[^1]: **Competing Interests:**The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\\\\n\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"PubMed Central\"}}',\n",

That being said, there is still much that can be done.\\\\n\\\\nShader 1 (SSAO):\\\\nMuch improved from before, though it is highly sensitive to dynamic lights (the klaxons for instance). In more static lighting conditions, it is only a 20fps drop or so. With the klaxons, SSAO gives me a drop of about 30-40fps\\\\nCan we get settings for SSAO quality and samples?\\\\n\\\\nShader 2 (Brightness/Color Correct):\\\\nNo appreciable impact on FPS.

Almost negligible.\\\\n\\\\nShader 4 (HUD Blur):\\\\nThis seems far too heavy. I\\'m getting about a 7fps drop. Would it not be simpler to just change to a different HUD overlay with the feathering baked in instead of using an apparently costly shader?\\\\n\\\\nShader 5 (Vignetting/Vaseline):\\\\nAnother pricey shader, costs me about 7-8fps in most situations. Surely, vignetting could be accomplished with less impact by using semi-transparent texture overlays instead of a costly shader, yes?\\\\n\\\\nShader 6 (Edge Smoothing):\\\\nAbout a 18-20fps hit for me. I find it also muddies up the ground textures, etc. I keep it off honestly, takes away the crispness of the things you\\'ve created.\\\\n\\\\nSome performance gotchas:\\\\nThe lightning. Oh, the lightning.\\\\n\\\\nI typically play with shaders 1,3,5 enabled for what I think \\\\\"looks best\\\\\".

(Hope this makes sense) ... That\\'s the challenge of doing pre-pre-alpha development ... it\\'s not always logical to do performance optimizations all the time! :)\\\\n\\\\nRegarding the image effects settings in general ... you know that we\\'re going for ultra high sci-fi realism and not glowing, colorful, lens flared madness ... \\\\\"cough\\\\\" Battlefield 3 \\\\\"cough\\\\\" Halo 4 ... but this is a process and we\\'re still a long way from the expression we want ... and at that point not all images effects will be toggleable (for competitive reasons) as gameplay will saturate every artistic choice we make! (Exhausted from sprinting will distort your vision via DOF, color correction, vignette etc.) and so forth!\\\\n\\\\nBut, rest assured I/we will listen and evaluate carefully in regard to everybody\\'s shit-filter on look and feel!\\\\n\\\\nNo problem Hicks :) I just wanted to point out how each one behaves currently.\\\\n\\\\nIf I run native (1280x1024 @ 75fps) on Fastest with everything off, I\\'m typically getting about 125fps solid. If I turn it up to Fantastic and keep everything off, I\\'m usually around 79fps or so.\\\\n\\\\nIn the previous Deadlock builds on Unity 3.x, I\\'d be at about 25fps on Fantastic with everything off and about 50fps on Fastest at native.\\\\n\\\\nThis represents a HUGE step forward in playability for myself, and I\\'d imagine most other people.\\\\n\\\\nI realize you\\'re going for a realistic vision for the game, and I completely agree with doing that. However, I think the color correct filter is a bit TOO aggressive. I have a high density of cone cells in my retina, as I imagine most other people do, so I see the world as a fundamentally colorful and vibrant place.\\\\n\\\\nThe effect of the color-correct filter is most prominent in the sunset period on the outside level. With it off, the world looks rich and colorful, as it should during the setting of the sun. With it on, everything gets very washed out and the visual impact of the setting sun is lessened considerably.\\\\n\\\\nI just want to caution you against making the mistake that many make in that \\\\\"real\\\\\" has to look like 50 shades of gray & brown everywhere.\\\\n\\\\nI do like the idea that you\\'ll present a consistent visual experience for competitive reasons, though I do think you (when you get there) should discuss with the community exactly what VFX they agree should be mandatory, and what ones should be optional. For instance, SSAO is not something that will render player shadows into the world, correct? So I would say this should be optional as it provides no tactical advantage, and can be quite heavy for some. Things like that need to be considered. I do think that using desaturation, vignetting, DOF changes, possibly image smearing, and other \\\\\"stress\\\\\" effects when fatigued/damaged/poisoned would serve to add depth to the gameplay, so I completely agree.\\\\n\\\\nIf you combined all the various effects into one script, what would happen? Would we still be able to toggle each effect, or would it simply be a ON/OFF for all 6 shaders?\\\\n\\\\nI know it would be a massive bit of extra work, but would you ever consider making multiple scripts that are combinations of the various settings users could choose? So a script with everything off, a script with everything on, a script with just 1,3,5 on, etc? Again, I realize there are a large number of combinations of the various effects, but in this manner, each option would be fully optimized to run well, correct?\\\\n\\\\nIn any case, I look forward to continued testing and experience with IM.

After losing large amounts of money, he is blackmailed into revealing the blueprints of a top-secret military laser weapon that can hit any target within 50 miles and is wanted by another underworld don named Saxena (Utpal Dutt). When the Indian police come to know of this, they assign the case to Inspector Vijay (also Amitabh Bachchan), who is a lookalike of Jai.\\\\n\\\\nJai and Vijay\\'s paths are soon intertwined when both coincidentally sent to Rome where Vijay is sent to retrieve evidence against underworld don Saxena by his former henchman and Jai is onto a money-making scheme where he would marry Mala (Neetu Singh) to inherit her money. Mala however, meets Vijay at the Rome airport and Vijay decides to go along with this to find out who his lookalike is. Jai meanwhile meets Shabnam (Zeenat Aman), a club dancer who mistakes him for Vijay, and was sent by Saxena to stop him on his mission to discover Saxena\\'s plans. It is later revealed that Jai and Vijay are actually long-lost twin brothers and together they team up to stop Saxena from retrieving the laser weapon.\\\\n\\\\nCast\\\\nAmitabh Bachchan as Jay / C.I.D.

       " '{\"text\": \"On Tuesday, Apple will change the way humans interact with electronic devices. All over again.\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps the biggest announcement at Apple\\\\u2019s iPhone event on Tuesday will be Assistant, Apple\\\\u2019s evolution of the Siri Personal Assistant Software. Siri, you\\\\u2019ll remember, is the company Apple picked up for a rumored $200 million in April of last year for, in Steve Jobs\\\\u2019 words, its \\\\u201cArtificial Intelligence\\\\u201d, not search or speech recognition.\\\\n\\\\nDuring Siri\\\\u2019s brief two months on its own, it described itself as a \\\\u2018VPA\\\\u2019:\\\\n\\\\nVirtual Personal Assistants (VPAs) represent the next generation interaction paradigm for the Internet. In today\\\\u2019s paradigm, we follow links on search results. With a VPA, we interact by having a conversation. We tell the assistant what we want to do, and it applies multiple services and information sources to help accomplish our task. Like a real assistant, a VPA is personal; it uses information about an individual\\\\u2019s preferences and interaction history to help solve specific tasks, and it gets better with experience.\\\\n\\\\nApple has long wanted to bring an Artificial Intelligence-based Personal Assistant to the masses. In the late 80\\\\u2019s, Apple made the Knowledge Navigator series of videos (example below) to showcase this ambition.\\\\n\\\\nIn the video, the professor mentions that someone wrote an article 5 years ago trashing Jill\\\\u2019s research (watch from 1:25 min onwards, at 1:50 min he mentions more details) \\\\u2013 The computer says the doctor\\\\u2019s name and says his article in 2006 \\\\u2013 which means the professor is in 2011. Ha! Thanks PBHK!\\\\n\\\\nThe world has come a long way since then, but as you\\\\u2019ll see on Tuesday, Apple had remarkable foresight way back in 1987.\\\\n\\\\nWe had the chance to speak to Siri\\\\u2019s co-founder and board member, Norman Winarsky\\\\u2026\\\\n\\\\nFirst, Some Background:\\\\nThe device input methods we\\\\u2019ve used in the past have first been the keyboard, then the mouse and more recently, there is the touch interface. All of these methods, while not invented by Apple, were \\\\u201cmainstreamed\\\\u201d by Steve Jobs\\\\u2019 company over the last thirty-five years.\\\\n\\\\nBut humans didn\\\\u2019t evolve to communicate with keyboards or mice or even a touch screen. We\\\\u2019ve contorted our bodies to deal with our computer tools (Hi RSI!) but really we\\\\u2019re hard-wired for talking and listening \\\\u2013 functions we, as a species, have been doing for tens of thousands of years.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, we haven\\\\u2019t yet invented a computer that can understand what we say, and more importantly, use that information to go find answers and relay that information back to us. That would require not only recognition of the language but the Artificial Intelligence to understand it, use it, and return something of value.\\\\n\\\\nWell, that\\\\u2019s not entirely true. In 2003, the US Government began the most ambitious Artificial Intelligence program in its history called the \\\\u201cCognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes\\\\u201d or CALO program. The name was inspired by the Latin word \\\\u201ccalonis\\\\u201d, which means \\\\u201csoldier\\\\u2019s servant\\\\u201d. Funded by DARPA as part of its Personal Assistant that Learns project, the program ran for five years and brought together more than 300 researchers from 25 of the top university and commercial research institutions, with the goal of \\\\u201cbuilding a new generation of cognitive assistants that can reason, learn from experience, be told what to do, explain what they are doing, reflect on their experience, and respond robustly to surprise.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe program was coordinated through SRI International in Menlo Park, CA. As the program ended in 2007, SRI took the knowledge gained by the CALO and some of its key players and formed Siri. SRI\\\\u2019s Norman Winarsky, the man uniquely positioned at the crossroads of the CALO project and the company spun off out of it talked to us about the implications of Apple mainstreaming \\\\u2018Assistant\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\n9to5Mac: What was your role in putting together Siri?\\\\n\\\\nNorm: As CALO was coming to an end, we realized that there were incredible commercial opportunities to build a smart personal assistant from what we learned over the five years of the CALO project. My job was getting funding (VC\\\\u2019s were Morgenthaler and Menlo Ventures)and assembling the team headed by Dag Kittlaus a former Motorola Executive. With him came Semantic Web genius Tom Gruber and Chief Architect of CALO Adam Cheyer. At the time of Apple purchase, the team was at 19 and growing. All three co-founders still work at Apple with much of the rest of the original team. I obviously stayed at SRI after the purchase.\\\\n\\\\n9to5Mac: Can you tell us a little bit about getting picked up by Apple? What was the process? How did they evaluate the company? Are any of the financials available?\\\\n\\\\nNorm: I am bound by non-disclosure on all of the information from the sale that is not public including the [rumored $200 million] sale price. What is notable is that Apple closed its purchase of Siri just two months after we went public with our app. You can probably draw your own conclusions from that.\\\\n\\\\n9to5Mac: How important is Nuance speech recognition to the Siri technology?\\\\n\\\\nNorm: It is a lot less important than you\\\\u2019d probably think. When we first built Siri, we use Vlingo for speech recognition and as such, at the time of purchase the speech recognition component is modular. Theoretically, if a better speech recognition comes along (or Apple buys one), they could likely replace Nuance without too much trouble. That being said, Nuance has far and away the most IP in speech synthesis technologies in the industry. We should know, SRI launched Nuance as one of our incubated companies in 1995 and it IPO\\\\u2019d in 2000.\\\\n\\\\n9to5Mac: What kind of power does the Siri AI take? Could it have caused the delay of the next iPhone?\\\\n\\\\nNorm: I\\\\u2019m not familiar with Apple\\\\u2019s roadmap and any delays but I can say that AI takes a lot of computing power. The Siri software needs to cache data, needs to access a big dataset at wide bandwidth and needs a big processor to crunch all of the numbers. When we originally released Siri for the iPhone 3GS, we had to perform all kinds of optimizations and shortcuts to get it to work efficiently. All I can say is that it will likely run much better on a faster phone.\\\\n\\\\n9to5Mac: Is this Siri \\\\u2018Assistant\\\\u2019 a big deal?\\\\n\\\\nNorm: Let me first say I have no knowledge of what Apple plans to do with the Siri purchase. I read the rumors just like everyone else and it appears that Apple is getting ready to reveal what it has done with Siri over the past year and a half (we were actually expecting it at WWDC). Make no mistake: Apple\\\\u2019s \\\\u2018mainstreaming\\\\u2019 Artificial Intelligence in the form of a Virtual Personal Assistant is a groundbreaking event. I\\\\u2019d go so far as to say it is a World-Changing event. Right now a few people dabble in partial AI enabled apps like Google Voice Actions, Vlingo or Nuance Go. Siri was many iterations ahead of these technologies, or at least it was two years ago. This is REAL AI with REAL market use. If the rumors are true, Apple will enable millions upon millions of people to interact with machines with natural language. The PAL will get things done and this is only the tip of the iceberg. We\\\\u2019re talking another technology revolution. A new computing paradigm shift.\\\\n\\\\nIt reminds me of another SRI Project: Doug Engelbart, Inventor of Mouse augmented human ability back in the \\\\u201960s. Just as Steve Jobs took that technology and ran with it, we believe that Apple will use Siri to start another revolution.\\\\n\\\\n9to5Mac: Thanks for your time Norm. This reminds us of the Steve Jobs computer is a bicycle for the mind quote:\\\\n\\\\nSome other interesting data on the founders:\\\\n\\\\nThe three founders are all still at Apple, though they work on other projects. We found Dag Kittlaus\\\\u2019 comments that he\\\\u2019s now making \\\\u201cthe next big thing into a really big thing\\\\u201d interesting (below).\\\\n\\\\n.\\\\n\\\\nAdam Cheyer demonstrated (PDF) the CALO Express application in 2007, just before starting Siri. The application ran on Windows CE because it was aimed at government use.\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps Tom Gruber at Semantic Web in 2008 just before Siri went public was most interesting:\\\\n\\\\n[vodpod id=Video.15499711&w=651&h=488&fv=]\\\\n\\\\nCome back to 9to5mac.com Tuesday at 10am Pacific for all of the announcements.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"Pile-CC\"}}',\n",

       " '{\"text\": \"A Lipid Transfer Protein Variant with a Mutant Eight-cysteine Motif Causes Photoperiod-thermo-sensitive Dwarfism in Rice.\\\\nPlant height is an important trait for plant architecture patterning and crop yield improvement. Although the pathways involving in gibberellins and brassinosteroid have been well studied, there are still many gaps in the picture of the networks controlling plant height. Here, we revealed that a dominant photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive dwarf mutant is caused by the active role of a mutated gene Ptd1, of which the wild-type gene encodes a non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP). The Ptd1 plants showed severe dwarfism under long-day and low-temperature conditions, but grew nearly normal under short-day and high-temperature conditions; these phenotypic variations were associated with the Ptd1 mRNA level and its protein accumulation. Furthermore, we found that the growth inhibition in Ptd1 might result from the special protein conformation of Ptd1 due to loss of two disulfide bonds in the Eight-cysteine motif (8-CM) that is conserved among nsLTPs. Our findings give new insights into the understanding of the novel function of disulfide bonds in 8-CM, and provide a new strategy for regulation of cell development and plant height, by modifying the amino acid residues involved in protein conformation patterning.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"PubMed Abstracts\"}}',\n",

       " '{\"text\": \"Bri-Chem Announces 52% Increase in EBITDA For Q3 and Record Quarterly Sales For USA Division\\\\n\\\\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - Nov. 12, 2014) -\\\\n\\\\nNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE U.S.\\\\n\\\\nBri-Chem Corp. (\\\\\"Bri-Chem\\\\\" or \\\\\"Company\\\\\") (TSX:BRY), a leading North American wholesale distributor and blender of oil and gas drilling fluids today announced its third quarter financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014. During the third quarter of 2014, Bri-Chem completed the sale of its Steel Pipe Manufacturing and Steel Pipe Distribution divisions to a USA based steel company effective July 15, 2014. As a result of the sale, the Company will not retain any steel pipe assets or conduct any further steel pipe business operations going forward and has therefore reclassified the associated assets and liabilities of these businesses from assets and liabilities held for sale in Q3 to assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations for all periods presented. Bri-Chem\\'s business operations, financial and corresponding operating results are now presented and concentrated entirely on its North American leading oil and gas drilling fluids distribution, blending & packaging businesses (\\\\\"Continued Operations\\\\\").\\\\n\\\\nFor Q3 2014, Bri-Chem\\'s consolidated revenues from Continued Operations increased 23.0% to $53,283,129 compared to $43,323,525 from the prior period in 2013. This quarter-over-quarter revenue increase is primarily as a result of significant market share growth from Bri-Chem\\'s USA drilling fluids distribution division which experienced record quarterly sales of $21,155,073. Consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were $134,416,336 compared to $105,140,508 for the comparable period of 2013, an increase of 27.8%. Earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation, and share-based payments expense (\\\\\"EBITDA\\\\\") was $6,460,579 or $ 0.27 per share and $11,346,886 or $0.47 per share respectively for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2014, compared to $4,241,153 and $9,078,710 respectively for the same periods in 2013. Net earnings for the three month period was $3,355,881 or $0.14 diluted earnings per share and $4,480,567 or $0.19 diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to net earnings of $1,940,291 and $3,469,900 respectively for the same periods in 2013.\\\\n\\\\nBri-Chem\\'s Canadian drilling fluids distribution division generated sales of $23,122,393 and $61,336,517 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to sales of $24,126,287 and $60,531,611 over the comparable periods in 2013. Drilling activity in Canada has remained relatively level year over year with the exception that a significant backlog of drilling activity experienced in Q3 2013 was caused by the extremely wet weather in Q2 2013, which delayed the start of the summer drilling programs until July 2013. In addition, this year the Canadian drilling fluids distribution division\\'s operations were also adversely impacted by very wet weather in Saskatchewan. The number of wells drilled in Q3 2014 in Western Canada was 3,022, compared to the 3,054 wells drilled in Q3 2013, representing a decrease of 1.0% quarter over quarter. Drilling rig utilization rates averaged 47.7% in Q3 2014 compared to 41.3% in Q3 2013, an increase of 6.4%. Year to date rig utilization has increased 5.3% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013.\\\\n\\\\nBri-Chem\\'s United States drilling fluids distribution division generated sales of $21,155,073 and $51,841,195 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2014, compared to revenues of $12,680,328 and $30,746,736 in the comparable periods of 2013, representing an increase of $8,474,745 or 66.8% quarter over quarter, while increasing 68.6% year over year. The USA fluids distribution division has continued to realize sales growth throughout Q3 2014 as a result of increased industry activity, and product and geographic expansion throughout the major resource plays in the USA. In the USA, the average number of active rigs running during the third quarter was 1,903, an increase of 7.6% quarter over quarter. The division has built a solid infrastructure with personnel and inventory to service the expanding needs of our customers. The states of Colorado, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Texas generated the majority of sales in the USA for the three months ended September 30, 2014. As at September 30, 2014 Bri-Chem had 18 operating warehouses, compared to 15 warehouses at September 30, 2013. The Company remains focused on expanding its product offerings as well as expanding into new geographic regions in the USA to meet the increasing demand for drilling fluids from an independent wholesaler.\\\\n\\\\nThe Canadian fluids blending and packaging division also continues to grow as the Company generated sales of $6,460,543 and $14,754,038 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the comparable prior year period sales of $6,068,098 and $13,413,349 representing 6.5% increase quarter over quarter. The division continues to increase market share by utilizing new expanded capacity to meet the increasing demand of our customers. The acquisition of Sun Coast Materials LLC in the third quarter of 2013, which operates as our USA fluids blending and packaging division, generated sales of $2,545,120 and $6,484,586 for the third quarter of 2014 and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $448,812 for Q3 2013.\\\\n\\\\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2014 the Company recorded an impairment expense of $15,434,501 to reflect the estimated fair value, less costs to sell of the net assets of the Steel Pipe divisions at their estimated fair value, less costs to sell. The loss from Discontinued Operations was $368,909 and $12,637,254 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2014 respectively.\\\\n\\\\nOutlook Summary\\\\n\\\\nWith the current volatile crude oil and natural gas prices that are being experienced, there is a level of uncertainty of the impact that these volatile prices will have on Canadian drilling activity in the short term. Canadian drilling activity in the fourth quarter of 2014 is expected to decrease as compared to the same period of the prior year. The Petroleum Services Association of Canada (PSAC) has forecasted 2,627 wells to be drilled in Western Canada for the fourth quarter of 2014, a forecasted decrease of 5.9% over 2013. PSAC has also forecasted that 9,660 wells will be drilled in Canada for 2015, which is 6.2% less than the number of wells estimated to be drilled in 2014. In the USA, the average number of active rigs operating during the third quarter of 2014 was 1,903, an increase of 7.6% over the third quarter of 2013. The average number of active rigs for the fourth quarter of 2014 is expected to be consistent with Q3 2014. We believe the increased activity in the USA will drive increased year over year sales and profitability in our fluids division throughout the rest of 2014. Bri-Chem will continue to invest in its USA drilling fluid market expansion plan with the goal of obtaining new market share. As we continue to gain market share in the USA drilling fluids market, more product and acquisition opportunities become available. Bri-Chem is also currently evaluating several acquisition opportunities in the stimulation and production chemical segments in both Canada and the USA marketplace.\\\\n\\\\nAbout Bri-Chem\\\\n\\\\nBri-Chem has established itself, through a combination of strategic acquisitions and organic growth, as the North American industry leader for the distribution and blending of oilfield drilling, completion, stimulation and production chemical fluids. We sell, blend, package and distribute a full range of drilling fluid products, cementing, acidizing and stimulation additives from 34 strategically located warehouses throughout Canada and the United States. Bri-Chem has been operating in Canada since 1985 and as a result of the increasing market demand for oilfield chemicals, we expanded into the United States in 2011 and have successfully obtained significant market penetration.

The terms \\\\\"autoxidative glycosylation\\\\\" and \\\\\"glycoxidation\\\\\" ([@B3]) were introduced at an early stage in this research field to highlight the importance of oxidation chemistry in AGE formation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free (decompartmentalized) metal ions were identified as key participants in the Maillard reaction, and chelators were identified as potent inhibitors of browning and cross-linking of proteins by glucose. Oxygen was described as a fixative of irreversible damage to proteins via the Maillard reaction, and today metal-catalyzed oxidation reactions and chemical modifications of proteins, including numerous AGEs ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}), advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs), and protein oxidation products, are implicated in many chronic diseases involving oxidative stress, including diabetes and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases ([@B1]--[@B5]).\\\\n\\\\n![Proposed mechanisms of action of aminoguanidine as a carbonyl and dicarbonyl trap.

At the bottom, aminoguanidine reacts with a dicarbonyl compound to form a triazine.](549fig1){#F1}\\\\n\\\\nAGE inhibitors {#s3}\\\\n==============\\\\n\\\\nAminoguanidine. {#s4}\\\\n---------------\\\\n\\\\nIn 1986, Brownlee et al. ([@B6]) introduced the first AGE inhibitor, aminoguanidine, as a trap or scavenger of reactive carbonyl intermediates in the Maillard reaction ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). In numerous studies in animal models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, aminoguanidine inhibited AGE formation in concert with inhibition of diabetic renal, retinal, neural, and vascular complications ([@B7]). Aminoguanidine is administered at a relatively high dose (typically 1 g/L in drinking water); in severely hyperglycemic rodents, which may consume their body weight in drinking water per day, this dose is equivalent to \\\\u223c1 g/kg/day. While the dose is enormous, it is not unreasonable; aminoguanidine has a short plasma half-life (\\\\u223c1 h), and AGE inhibitors must be present at a concentration sufficient to continuously react with and trap chemical intermediates in the Maillard reaction ([Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). High aminoguanidine concentrations are required to drive sluggish and thermodynamically unfavorable trapping reactions to completion. More reactive carbonyl traps are likely to be toxic, e.g., because of their reaction with and depletion of vitamin B~6~, pyridoxal. While aminoguanidine is the prototype AGE inhibitor, its proposed mechanism of action is based completely on model chemical studies in vitro. Today, \\\\\\\\>25 years since its discovery, there is no published evidence that aminoguanidine traps AGE precursors in vivo; i.e., none of the types of adducts described in [Fig. 1](#F1){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"} have been detected in urine or plasma.\\\\n\\\\nPyridoxamine. {#s5}\\\\n-------------\\\\n\\\\nThe B~6~ vitamer pyridoxamine was described as an Amadorin or post-Amadori AGE inhibitor, trapping products derived from the Amadori compound fructoselysine, the first stable glucose adduct to protein ([@B8]). Pyridoxamine is now considered to have multiple mechanisms of action: *1*) blocking oxidation of the Amadori intermediate; *2*) trapping of reactive carbonyl and dicarbonyl compounds derived from the Amadori compound; *3*) chelation of metal ion catalysts of oxidation chemistry; and *4*) scavenging of ROS ([@B9]). As observed with aminoguanidine, pyridoxamine inhibited the full range of diabetic vascular complications in animal models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes ([@B8],[@B9]). In addition to their AGE-inhibitory activity, both aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine significantly lowered plasma triglycerides and cholesterol ([@B10]). Although pyridoxamine adducts of lipid peroxidation products have been identified in animal models of diabetes ([@B11]), like aminoguanidine, not a single product of reaction of pyridoxamine with a dicarbonyl intermediate in AGE formation, such as methylglyoxal or deoxyglucosones, has been identified in biological systems. Considering the sensitivity and specificity of modern mass spectrometric techniques, it seems unlikely that this is the result of technical limitations.\\\\n\\\\nOther carbonyl-trapping agents. {#s6}\\\\n-------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nA number of other compounds with reactive nucleophilic functional groups and carbonyl-trapping activity in vitro are effective as AGE inhibitors in rodent models of diabetes, including 2,3-diaminophenazine, OPB-9195, tenilsetam, penicillamine, and several derivatives of aminoguanidine ([Fig. 2*A*](#F2){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}) ([@B4],[@B5],[@B12]). However, like aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine, no products of reaction of these compounds with intermediates in glycation or glycoxidation reactions have been identified in vivo. Although penicillamine, carnosine, and possibly lipoic acid have carbonyl-trapping activity in vitro, their potent chelating activity, measured by inhibition of metal-catalyzed ascorbate oxidation ([@B13]) ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}), would contribute to their AGE-inhibitory activity. To the best of our knowledge, analogs of these compounds with AGE-inhibitory activity, but lacking in chelating activity, have not been identified.\\\\n\\\\n###### \\\\n\\\\nStructures of AGE inhibitors. *A*: First-generation AGE inhibitors. *B*: Novel LR compounds (adapted from Rahbar and Figarola \\\\\\\\[[@B18]\\\\\\\\]).\\\\n\\\\n![](549fig2a)\\\\n\\\\n![](549fig2b)\\\\n\\\\n###### \\\\n\\\\nIC~50~ of various compounds that inhibit metal-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate\\\\\\\\*\\\\n\\\\n![](549tbl1)\\\\n\\\\nThiamine and benfotiamine. {#s7}\\\\n--------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThiamine and benfotiamine are often described as AGE inhibitors but have a much broader spectrum of action. In a unifying hypothesis on the mechanism of diabetes complications ([@B14],[@B15]), Brownlee ([@B14]) and Giacco and Brownlee ([@B15]) proposed that inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) by mitochondrial-derived ROS is a pivotal step in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications. The resultant accumulation of glycolytic intermediates leads to activation of the polyol, hexosamine, and diacylglycerol--protein kinase C pathways and increased formation of methylglyoxal-derived AGEs and expression of the receptor for AGE (RAGE). Thiamine and benfotiamine correct these metabolic changes, it is proposed, by diverting glucose metabolism from glycolysis through activation of transketolase, the thiamine-dependent enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) ([@B16]). Indeed, benfotiamine reverses all of the observed metabolic changes induced by hyperglycemia in vitro, including formation of methylglyoxal-derived AGEs; it also inhibits complications in diabetic animals and has shown promise in clinical trials ([@B16]). Transgenic overexpression of superoxide dismutase, which would limit ROS-dependent inactivation of GAPDH, also reversed many of the metabolic changes, as well as AGE formation, and inhibited development of complications in diabetic mice ([@B15]).\\\\n\\\\nStudies with thiamine and benfotiamine illustrate that alterations in enzymatic pathways in diabetes may have a significant impact on oxidative stress and formation of AGEs. Glyceraldehyde-3-phophate, a major precursor of methylglyoxal, is one product increased as a result of inhibition of GAPDH by mitochondrial-derived ROS. Glyceraldehyde-3-phophate is not just a source of methylglyoxal AGEs but is also among the most readily autoxidized sugars and thereby a source of superoxide for metal-catalyzed Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions, leading to increased production of hydroxyl radicals. Effects on the concentration of hexose phosphates would explain reported effects of thiamine and benfotiamine on formation of other AGEs. However, benfotiamine also has anti-inflammatory effects in diseases other than diabetes ([@B16]), e.g., endotoxemia, suggesting that its mechanism of action is not limited to activation of the PPP or other thiamine-dependent pathways. There are, to our knowledge, no reports on the chelating activity of thiamine or benfotiamine, but both thiamine, in the form of thiamine diphosphate, and benfotiamine, because of its complex multidentate structure, are likely to be effective in chelation of metal ions.\\\\n\\\\nLalezari-Rahbar compounds and the effects of chelation. {#s8}\\\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nLalezari-Rahbar (LR) compounds (named after the developers) are a new class of AGE inhibitors, a diverse group of aromatic organic acids with ureido and carboxamide functional groups ([Fig. 2*B*](#F2){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}) ([@B17],[@B18]). These compounds have been shown to protect against complications in animal models of diabetes and to have profound lipid-lowering effects ([@B19],[@B20]), mimicking the effects of aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine in diabetic rats ([@B10]). The common effects of the AGE inhibitors on AGEs and plasma lipids suggest similar underlying mechanisms of action. Yet, the LR compounds lack nucleophilic groups and do not trap carbonyl compounds under physiological conditions, even in vitro. Regardless, they are potent inhibitors of AGE formation in diabetic rats and mice at doses of 50 mg/L in drinking water, i.e., at \\\\u22645% of the molar dose commonly used for aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine. The LR compounds appear to inhibit AGE formation primarily through their chelating activity; they are potent inhibitors of metal-catalyzed ascorbate oxidation, with half-maximal inhibition (IC~50~) observed in the micromolar (micromole per liter) range ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). Another recently described class of AGE inhibitors, derivatives of edaravone, has also been shown to have poor carbonyl-trapping activity but potent AGE-inhibitory activity ([@B21]). The IC~50~ for inhibition of ascorbate oxidation by TM2002, the most effective of these compounds, was 84 \\\\u03bcmol/L ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}).\\\\n\\\\nThe LR compounds and edaravone derivatives have provided novel insight into the mechanism of action of AGE inhibitors. They suggest that chelation alone, independent of carbonyl trapping, is sufficient to inhibit AGE formation and protect against diabetes complications. Chelators would not only inhibit autoxidative glycosylation and glycoxidation but also inhibit enzymatic and metal-catalyzed ROS production after ligation of AGEs with scavenger receptors, such as RAGE. Thus, LR-90 inhibits the inflammatory response (increased expression of RAGE, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, cyclooxygenase-2, and NADPH oxidase) in monocytes stimulated with the RAGE ligand, S100b, and also blocks the increase in monocyte endothelial cell adhesion ([@B22]). LR-90 also inhibited nuclear factor-\\\\u03baB activation after activation of the inflammatory response by tumor necrosis factor-\\\\u03b1, suggesting that AGE inhibitors may exert wide-ranging effects on oxidative stress and inflammation by mechanisms other than carbonyl trapping.\\\\n\\\\nChelation is a common, but commonly overlooked, characteristic of most drugs with multiple functional groups. The chelating activity of AGE inhibitors varies widely: aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine inhibit ascorbate oxidation with IC~50~ in the 1--5 mmol/L range, while carnosine, diaminophenazine, OPB-9195, and tenilsetam are effective in the 5--50 \\\\u03bcmol/L range ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}) ([@B23]). Though rigorous comparisons have not been conducted, the weaker the chelator, e.g., aminoguanidine or pyridoxamine, the higher the concentration generally used to inhibit the Maillard reaction in vitro and, in general, the higher the dose required to achieve efficacy in vivo. Even a weak chelator, however, in sufficient amount may deplete free or weakly bound metal ions by promoting their excretion in urine or bile.\\\\n\\\\nACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and other antihypertensive agents {#s9}\\\\n================================================================================\\\\n\\\\nAGE inhibitors are not the only drugs that inhibit AGE formation. Miyata et al. ([@B24],[@B25]) demonstrated that ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit the formation of AGEs in Maillard reactions in vitro. These compounds were poor carbonyl traps and were proposed to act primarily by inhibiting the oxidative formation, rather than by trapping, of reactive carbonyl intermediates. Several of the ACEIs and ARBs were shown to be potent inhibitors of metal-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate, with IC~50~ generally in the 1--10 \\\\u03bcmol/L range ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). Forbes et al. ([@B26]) demonstrated that the ACEI ramipril, at \\\\u223c10 \\\\u03bcmol/L in drinking water (\\\\u223c0.1% the dose of aminoguanidine), was comparable with aminoguanidine in inhibiting renal AGE formation and albuminuria in diabetic rats. In these studies, renal nitrotyrosine was also decreased in both ramipril- and aminoguanidine-treated animals, suggesting that both compounds inhibit AGE formation, in part, through effects on ROS production. Liu et al. ([@B27]) showed that renoprotection by the ACEI benazepril in a spontaneously hypertensive (nondiabetic) rat model was also accompanied by a decrease in AGE accumulation and expression of RAGE in the kidney, as well as decreased expression of NADPH oxidase p47phox and other biomarkers of oxidative stress. Monacelli et al. ([@B28]) reported that the ARB valsartan also decreased plasma and urinary AGEs in type 2 diabetic patients.\\\\n\\\\nThe relationship between the AGE-inhibitory and chelating activities of ACEIs and ARBs has not been systematically studied. The IC~50~ for ascorbate oxidation is 110 \\\\u03bcmol/L for the ACEI temocaprilat ([@B24]) and \\\\\\\\<10 \\\\u03bcmol/L for AVE8048, the active metabolite of the combination ACEI/vasopeptidase inhibitor AVE7688, which was a more potent AGE inhibitor ([@B29]). Izuhara et al. ([@B30]) evaluated more than 100 ARB derivatives and focused on the compound R147176, which had potent AGE-inhibitory activity in vitro and also a low (\\\\u223c3 \\\\u03bcmol/L) IC~50~ for ascorbate oxidation. Although R147176 had low affinity for the angiotensin receptor 1 and had minimal blood pressure--lowering activity, it was an effective inhibitor of nephropathy in three different rat models of hypertension and/or diabetes. R147176 has a core structure common to several ARBs, suggesting that the benefits of many ARBs are at least partly the result of their chelating and antioxidant activity ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). Nangaku et al. ([@B31]) reported that the antihypertensive agent hydralazine, which does not interact with the renin-angiotensin system, also protected against nephropathy in the diabetic rat and was a potent AGE inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo; hydralazine has an IC~50~ for ascorbate oxidation \\\\u223c1 \\\\u03bcmol/L ([@B31]). In their comparison of the ARB olmesartan (IC~50~ \\\\u223c5 \\\\u03bcmol/L) with hydralazine, the authors noted peak plasma concentration of \\\\u223c10 \\\\u03bcmol/L for both drugs in clinical studies, indicating that tissue concentrations of the drugs should be sufficient to inhibit metal-catalyzed oxidation and glycoxidation reactions in vivo.\\\\n\\\\nMiyata et al. ([@B32]) have summarized the evidence that antihypertensive agents have a range of renoprotective effects, independent of their blood pressure--lowering activity. Prominent among these effects is inhibition of oxidative stress, resulting in *1*) decreased AGE formation, *2*) decreased renal iron deposition, *3*) decreased RAGE expression, and *4*) decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells. All of these observations are consistent with the chelating and antioxidant activity of antihypertensive agents, which would limit both formation of AGEs and activation of AGE-RAGE--mediated inflammatory signaling cascades. The fact that ACEIs and ARBs are so effective in inhibition of AGE formation may explain in part why AGE inhibitors, despite their introduction over 25 years ago ([@B6]), have not found use in clinical management of diabetes complications: they may provide little added protection in patients already being treated with ACEIs and ARBs.\\\\n\\\\nAGE breakers {#s10}\\\\n============\\\\n\\\\nThe original AGE breaker, *N*-phenacylthiazolium bromide (PTB) ([@B33]), its dimethylthiazolium analog alagebrium (ALT)-711 ([@B34]), and recently described pyridinium analogs TRC4186 and TRC4149 ([@B35],[@B36]) ([Fig. 3](#F3){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}) were designed to cleave AGE cross-links in tissue proteins. As support for their mechanism of action, these compounds *1*) released AGE albumin from preformed AGE-albumin-collagen complexes, *2*) released immunoglobulins bound to red cells of diabetic rats, and *3*) reversed or decreased collagen cross-linking in diabetic rats. Despite these observations, not a single AGE cross-link structure identified in tissue proteins to date ([Fig. 4](#F4){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}) contains a dicarbonyl structure susceptible to the proposed mechanism of action of AGE breakers ([Fig. 3](#F3){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). Indeed, the proposed target of AGE breakers, dicarbonyl cross-links, would be reactive carbonyl compounds, which are unlikely to accumulate in protein. Regardless of their target or mechanism of action, AGE breakers increase vascular elasticity and improve cardiovascular function in aging humans, in animal models of diabetes, and in other diseases ([@B5],[@B34],[@B35],[@B37]).\\\\n\\\\n![Structures (*top panel*) and proposed mechanism of action (*bottom panel*) of AGE breakers. According to this scheme, the dinucleophilic AGE breaker adds across a dicarbonyl AGE cross-link, followed by an internal rearrangement to cleave the dicarbonyl bond, breaking the cross-link. Following hydrolysis, the AGE breaker is regenerated, leaving a chemically inert CML on one peptide and a chemically reactive aldehyde functional group on the other peptide involved in the cross-link. (Adapted from Vasan et al. \\\\\\\\[[@B33]\\\\\\\\].)](549fig3){#F3}\\\\n\\\\n![Structures of AGE cross-links identified in tissue proteins. Lys-Arg cross-links are shown in the *top panel* and Lys-Lys cross-links in the *lower panel*. Compounds with two or three carbon cross-links, e.g., GODIC, MODIC, GOLD, MOLD, and K~2~P, may be derived from both carbohydrates and lipids, i.e., they are AGE/ALEs. All of these compounds are considered to be irreversible AGE cross-links in proteins. Pentosidine, the vesperlysines, crosslines, and fluorolink are fluorescent and contribute to the increase in yellow-brown color and fluorescence of collagen in diabetes and aging. GODIC, glyoxal-derived imidazolium cross-link; MODIC, methylglyoxal-derived imidazolium cross-link; GOLD, glyoxal-lysine dimer; MOLD, methylglyoxal-lysine dimer.](549fig4){#F4}\\\\n\\\\nYang et al. ([@B38]) demonstrated that although AGE breakers cleaved dicarbonyl structures in model compounds, they did not cleave cross-links in insoluble skin or tendon collagen of diabetic rats or cleave cross-links in RNase polymerized by reaction with glucose in vitro. In all of the studies demonstrating the activity of AGE breakers in vitro, fresh rat skin or tail collagens (unprocessed by dialysis or acid extraction to remove labile intermediates or cross-links) were used for analysis of cross-link breaking activity. In contrast, the lack of AGE-breaking activity was demonstrated with the acetic acid--extracted insoluble fraction of skin collagen, which would lack the labile (reversible) intermediates and cross-links. Similarly, red cells may have proteins bound to their surface membranes by labile Schiff base (imine) bonds. These, like the labile Schiff base fraction of glycated hemoglobin, would dissociate during incubation with AGE breakers. Overall, it is unlikely that AGE breakers react according to the reaction scheme shown in [Fig. 3](#F3){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}. Indeed, one of the proposed products of AGE breaking is the AGE N^\\\\u03b5^-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), which has been identified as a ligand for RAGE and would thereby initiate a proinflammatory response. In addition, the protein is left with a four-carbon carbohydrate fragment with a reactive aldehyde group, which would participate in further AGE formation. Thus, it is difficult to rationalize beneficial effects from the proposed mechanism of action of AGE breakers.\\\\n\\\\nDespite the lack of evidence for their AGE-breaking activity, AGE breakers are potent chelators, and their hydrolysis products have even stronger chelating activity than the intact compounds ([@B23]) ([Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). In addition, all of the activities ascribed to AGE breakers in in vitro assays, including dissociation of AGE-albumin complexes and immunoglobulin adducts on red cells, and in vivo effects on collagen cross-linking have been replicated in detail with several LR compounds ([@B17],[@B18]), which lack functional groups that could cleave dicarbonyl compounds. In summary, despite several animal model and clinical studies that convincingly demonstrate the merits of AGE breakers for treatment of cardiovascular and renal pathology in diabetes and aging ([@B4],[@B5],[@B34]--[@B37]), the effects of these compounds are unlikely to be related to their proposed mechanism of action and may be explained largely, if not completely, by their chelating and antioxidant activities. Chelation, by inhibition of glycoxidation reactions, would limit the progression from AGE precursor to AGE cross-link, enabling the rejuvenation of the extracellular matrix by turnover of cross-linked proteins and biosynthesis of native matrix proteins.\\\\n\\\\nAldose reductase inhibitors {#s11}\\\\n===========================\\\\n\\\\nAldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) are designed to block excessive metabolism of glucose through the sorbitol pathway, thereby protecting against accumulation of fructose, dicarbonyl intermediates, and imbalances in NADPH- and glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses. ARIs have a diverse range of structures, with side effects often attributable to their lack of inhibitor specificity ([@B39]). While their chelating activity has not been investigated systematically, all of them contain functional groups with potential chelating activity, including carboxyl, amino, imino, imidazole, oxo, thio, and hydroxyl groups. Wolff and colleagues showed that ARIs inhibited metal-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbate and lipids ([@B40]), and Nakamura et al. ([@B41]) reported that the protective effects of the ARI NZ-314, a trioxoimidazolidine derivative, against diabetic neuropathy were in large part mimicked by the copper chelator trientine (triethylenetetramine). There are also several reports that ARIs inhibit AGE formation in diabetes and aging ([@B5],[@B42]). Although they may act by reducing the concentration of AGE precursors, secondary mechanisms of action, such as chelation, may be important in understanding the broader impacts of these compounds on the pathology of diabetes and aging.\\\\n\\\\nChelators {#s12}\\\\n=========\\\\n\\\\nAlterations in iron and copper homeostasis are a characteristic feature of diabetes, evidenced by deposition of iron and copper in heart, kidney, and other tissues ([@B43],[@B44]). Underlying the alterations in copper homeostasis are defects in copper absorption, tissue distribution, and an increase in loosely bound (chelatable) copper in tissues ([@B43]--[@B45]). Cooper (summarized in [@B45]) reported that, compared with control subjects, type 2 diabetic patients had higher basal urinary copper excretion and a greater increase in urinary copper in response to oral administration of triethylenetetramine, a well-tolerated copper chelator used clinically for treatment of Wilson disease. Administration of triethylenetetramine for 6 months caused a significant \\\\u223c5% reversion of left ventricular mass toward normal in type 2 diabetic patients compared with an increase of 3% in left ventricular mass in untreated patients; these changes occurred without effects on blood pressure or blood glucose concentration. Like AGE inhibitors and breakers, triethylenetetramine also protected rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes against development of cardiovascular and renal pathology, including left ventricular dysfunction and collagen accumulation, renal fibrosis, and albuminuria. Triethylenetetramine also affected the renal proteome, altering the expression of numerous proteins involved in cellular metabolism, ion transport, and oxidative stress in the kidney of rats with STZ-induced diabetes. In later studies, Baynes and Murray ([@B46]) demonstrated that triethylenetetramine inhibited structural and functional changes in the heart and kidney of Zucker diabetic rats, a model of type 2 diabetes. Consistent with the studies in type 1 animal models and clinical studies ([@B46]), protection of cardiac function in type 2 diabetic rats was achieved without effect on blood pressure or blood glucose concentration. The effect of triethylenetetramine on tissue AGEs is still unknown.\\\\n\\\\nBaynes and Murray ([@B46]) and Nagai et al. ([@B47]) evaluated the effects of citrate, a relatively nonspecific chelator, on progression of diabetes complications. Citrate, at the same dose as triethylenetetramine (1 g/L in drinking water), provided comparable protection against cardiac structural and functional changes in the Zucker type 2 diabetic rat. In rats with STZ-induced diabetes, citrate also inhibited albuminuria, cataractogenesis, and ketosis ([@B47]). The effects of citrate on ketosis have previously been reported, but the study of Nagai et al. ([@B47]) demonstrated that citrate also inhibited formation of two AGEs, both CML and N^\\\\u03b5^-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), in the lens. This is the first evidence that even a common dietary chelator found in citrus fruits and drinks may inhibit AGE formation and protect against development of diabetes complications. Although citrate is known to promote intestinal absorption of copper and iron, there is no information on its overall effects on metal ion homeostasis in vivo or on AGE formation in other tissues. There are numerous reports in the literature on the benefits of plant extracts and nutraceuticals (e.g., rutin, polyphenols, quercetin, resveratrol) against diabetes complications. Some of these compounds also inhibit AGE formation in diabetic animals, and it is possible that they may work, in part, by limiting the uptake or promoting the excretion of metal ions through chelating activity.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the puzzling aspects of the studies is that triethylenetetramine, which is a weak iron chelator and does not appear to affect overall iron balance ([@B45]), has such an impact on diabetes complications, when both iron and copper excess are apparent in diabetes ([@B43],[@B48]). It is also clear that Wilson disease, which is characterized by severe copper overload in tissues and high levels of chelatable copper, does not lead to the characteristic complications of diabetes, although this might be obscured by the severe hepatic disease. Although iron is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications and although specific iron chelators, such as desferoxamine, have shown beneficial effects in treatment of diabetes both in animal models and in clinical studies ([@B48],[@B49]), particularly in patients with iron overload diseases, the iron-chelating activity of various drugs has not been well studied, possibly because of the facile oxidation and precipitation of iron salts at neutral pH under air. It is likely that the copper and iron work together in diabetes; the disorder in copper homeostasis may lead to oxidation of iron and deposition of insoluble, but potentially redox active, ferric iron in tissues. These metals could cocatalyze oxidative stress and resultant inflammation, probably exacerbated by mitochondrial dysfunction and hypoxia in diabetes. The rapid elimination of decompartmentalized copper by triethylenetetramine would intercept the ROS-generating cycle, possibly leading to a more gradual leaching of iron from tissues and then to restoration of vascular tone.\\\\n\\\\nConclusions and perspective {#s13}\\\\n===========================\\\\n\\\\nWe have presented evidence here that the activity of AGE inhibitors and breakers on the formation of AGEs and development of diabetes complications may be explained in large part by their chelating activity or the chelating activity of products of their hydrolysis and/or metabolism. In addition, we propose that the AGE-inhibitory activity of other drugs commonly used for treatment of diabetes complications, including ACEIs, ARBs and ARIs, may also be attributed to their chelation activity. These compounds, as well as AGE inhibitors and breakers, have a diverse range of structures, and other functions clearly come into play with specific compounds, e.g., antihypertensive agents; however, chelation stands out as a likely, common mechanism of their action on AGE formation. Higher doses are required for weaker and more polar chelators, such as aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine, while more hydrophobic compounds, such as the LR compounds, ACEIs, ARBs, and ARIs, work effectively at lower doses, probably because of differences in bioavailability, plasma, or tissue half-lives or metabolism. Hydrophobic chelators may also penetrate and concentrate in membranous compartments and remove loosely bound metal ions from subcellular compartments. It is also possible that some chelators may shift the redox potential of iron or copper, affecting their catalytic activity in a way that could exacerbate oxidative stress and diabetes complications. To date, there are few reports on the effects of any of these compounds on metal-ion homeostasis, and AGEs have not been measured in renal or vascular tissues or in collagen after treatment with chelators. Such experiments are essential to test the hypothesis presented in this article that chelation is a fundamental mechanism of action of the wide range of compounds that affect AGE formation in diabetes. While we have focused this discussion on AGEs and AGE inhibitors and breakers, lipoxidation reactions proceed in concert with glycoxidation and oxidation in tissues and AGE inhibitors also inhibit lipoxidation reactions ([@B11]), so it will be important to determine the extent to which the formation of ALEs, as well as other biomarkers of oxidative stress in diabetes, is inhibited by chelators. Finally, the interplay between iron and copper in oxidative stress, diabetes, and its complications deserves greater attention. Both iron and copper chelators inhibit AGE formation in model systems in vitro, and it is equally likely that these metals have both unique and complementary roles in vivo.\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, although \\\\\"Quackwatch\\\\\" appears among the first three URLs in a Bing, Google, or Yahoo search for \\\\\"chelation therapy,\\\\\" we argue that there is good reason to invest in further research on chronic, low-dose, oral chelation therapy for treatment of diabetes and its complications.

The perfusion curve can be divided into a first phase (up to the first-pass peak) and a second phase (the curve after the initial peak). The second phase of the MAG3 perfusion curve is usually ascending in contrast to the descending Tc-99m DTPA curve. This ascending MAG3 curve reflects early tubular extraction of MAG3. However, the second phase of the MAG3 curve is sometimes flat or descending. We hypothesized that a flat or descending curve reflects poor early tubular extraction and therefore graft dysfunction. Ninety-two studies of 59\\' renal transplant patients were retrospectively reviewed. The second phase of the perfusion curve was visually classified as ascending, flat, or descending. 77.2% of studies had ascending curves, 16.3% flat curves, and 6.5% descending curves. A descending curve had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% for medical graft dysfunction, while a flat curve had a PPV of 93.3%. A nonascending second phase curve was specific (96.4%) but not sensitive (33.9%) for graft dysfunction. Patients with acute tubular necrosis were not significantly more likely to have a nonascending curve than those with acute rejection. There was no significant difference in creatinine level between patients with medical graft dysfunction and ascending vs. nonascending curves.

Mothers reported on 1 specific conflict interaction with their 5- to 8-year-old child and their work, home, and relationship stress through online surveys each day for 7 consecutive days. Diary data from 142 mothers were analyzed in 6 multilevel models, each including within- and between-family levels of a stressor predicting collaborative or oppositional conflict qualities. Results suggested that families in the sample differed from each other, and also varied during the week, in collaborative and oppositional conflict qualities as well as stress in all 3 domains. Mothers reported a greater degree of oppositional conflict qualities on days characterized by higher perceptions of home chaos. Additionally, mothers who reported higher average levels of negativity in romantic relationships endorsed oppositional conflict qualities to a greater extent than mothers with lower relationship negativity. Two multilevel models including all 3 stressors in relation to collaborative and oppositional conflict revealed that for mothers managing multiple roles, average romantic relationship stress was the most important unique contributor to mother-child conflict qualities and daily relationship stress was particularly influential among mothers with sons compared to those with daughters.

       " '{\"text\": \"1. Introduction {#sec1}\\\\n===============\\\\n\\\\nOvernutrition is defined as excess nutrient supply for normal metabolism and growth. Overnutrition has been linked to both insulin (INS) resistance and *\\\\u03b2*-cell dysfunction \\\\\\\\[[@B1], [@B2]\\\\\\\\]. The global obesity epidemic is a major reason for the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Obese individuals may have CVD complications, including hypertension, cardiac diastolic dysfunction, macro- and microvascular disease, and early onset of cardiovascular morbidity \\\\\\\\[[@B3], [@B4]\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nChronic overnutrition leads to activation of the evolutionarily conserved mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream signaling molecule, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) \\\\\\\\[[@B5]\\\\\\\\]. Activation of the INS receptor triggers phosphorylation of tyrosine residues and subsequent activation of the INS docking proteins (INS receptor substrates 1 and 2; IRS-1, IRS-2). It results in the phosphorylation/activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B (Akt). Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 appears to play an important role in the antiapoptotic actions of INS in *\\\\u03b2*-cells \\\\\\\\[[@B6]\\\\\\\\]. mTOR/S6K1 signaling impairs INS metabolic signaling through enhanced serine (Ser) phosphorylation of IRS-1, a mechanism implicated in the pathogenesis of INS resistance. Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 result in their targeting for proteosomal degradation, which, in turn, leads to impaired INS metabolic signaling \\\\\\\\[[@B7]\\\\\\\\]. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inactivates and degrades glucagon-like peptide- (GLP-) 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) \\\\\\\\[[@B8]\\\\\\\\], thereby limiting the favorable metabolic action of these proteins. DPP-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin (SIT) are a new therapeutic strategy for improving glucose metabolism in patients with T2DM.\\\\n\\\\nSIT inhibits DPP-4, which is responsible for degrading GLP-1. Inhibition of DPP-4 increases circulating levels of GLP-1. GLP-1 is produced by L-cells in small and large intestines in response to nutrient intake \\\\\\\\[[@B9]\\\\\\\\]. GLP-1 is degraded by DPP-4 in the bloodstream \\\\\\\\[[@B9]\\\\\\\\]. SIT also regulates GLP-1 receptor and cannabinoid receptor- (CB-) 1 gene expressions, which are associated with appetite regulation in diabetic rat and may decrease oxidative stress and liver tissue damage \\\\\\\\[[@B10]\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nFemale mice showed that they are more prone to develop obesity than male mice. An 8-week administration of Western diet (WD) abolished the enhancement of insulin sensitivity and induced cardiac diastolic dysfunction in female mice but not in male mice \\\\\\\\[[@B11]\\\\\\\\]. SIT improves glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in both human and animal models \\\\\\\\[[@B12], [@B13]\\\\\\\\]. SIT also attenuated the annual exacerbation of diastolic dysfunction in patients with T2DM for 24 months \\\\\\\\[[@B14]\\\\\\\\]. However, the mechanism underlying this protective effect of SIT remains unclear. In this study, we used the overnutrition obesity female mouse model to evaluate whether a 12-week treatment with SIT improves cardiac diastolic dysfunction and glucose homeostasis and reduces *\\\\u03b2*-cell dysfunction. We hypothesized that the SIT may exert its effect through insulin metabolic signaling molecule, p70 ribosomal S6K1, and through phosphorylation of INS docking proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2.\\\\n\\\\n2. Methods {#sec2}\\\\n==========\\\\n\\\\n2.1. Animals {#sec2.1}\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\nThe experimental study was approved by the Suzhou Science and Technology Town Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Six-week-old wild-type control (C57BLKS/J) female mice were purchased from the animal center of Soochow University (Suzhou, China) and were housed under standard laboratory conditions. Groups of 6-week-old mice were fed a WD consisting of high-fat (46%) and a high-carbohydrate component as constituted with sucrose (17.5%) and high-fructose corn syrup (17.5%) and water for 12 weeks with or without SIT (15\\\\u2009mg/kg/day) \\\\\\\\[[@B15]\\\\\\\\]. Another group of age-matched controls were fed regular mouse chow (CD) with or without SIT for the same period of time.\\\\n\\\\n2.2. Biochemical Examination {#sec2.2}\\\\n----------------------------\\\\n\\\\nVenous blood sample was collected from fasting mice for four hours. Glucose and insulin assay were analyzed using an alpha track II glucometer and an ultrasensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chemical Inc., Wakefield, MA, United States). Samples were drawn immediately prior to the start of the treatment period and at the end of the study. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured using a DCA vantage analyzer (Seimens City, United States). Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides, serum potassium, and sodium were measured using an Olympus AU680 automated chemistry analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Triglyceride content in liver samples was also analyzed \\\\\\\\[[@B16]\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\n2.3. Echocardiography {#sec2.3}\\\\n---------------------\\\\n\\\\nTwo-dimensional echocardiograms were performed as described previously \\\\\\\\[[@B11]\\\\\\\\]. The myocardial performance index (MPI) was calculated as the sum of isovolumic contraction and relaxation times divided by ejection time. The data was obtained by a pulsed-wave Doppler, and parameters were assessed. Calculations were made in accordance with the specific guidelines for rodent echocardiography. All data were acquired and analyzed by a single-blinded observer using Echo PAC (GE Vingmed) offline processing.\\\\n\\\\n2.4. INS Signaling Protein Assay {#sec2.4}\\\\n--------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nPancreas islet cells will be isolated by type V collagenase digestion, followed by Ficoll 400 gradient separation, as described in \\\\\\\\[[@B17]\\\\\\\\]. Proteins involved in INS signaling, including IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, and S6K1, will be analyzed in pancreatic islets by Western blot.\\\\n\\\\n2.5. Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining {#sec2.5}\\\\n-----------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nSpecimens of the hearts were fixed by formalin for 24 hours, dehydrated by 70%, 80%, and 90% ethanol for 3 hours, respectively, then 100% ethanol I for 2 hours and 100% ethanol II for 2 hours, and vitrified by xylene I and xylene II for 20 minutes. After immersing in paraffin I and II for 40 minutes, the specimens were embedded and sliced (5\\\\u2009*\\\\u03bc*m). Staining was performed as follows: hematoxylin staining for 15 minutes, hydrochloric acid alcohol solution for 35 seconds decoloring, eosin staining for 10 minutes, and 90% ethanol for 40 seconds decoloring. Then, neutral balsam was used for mounting, and the section was observed and photographed under the microscope \\\\\\\\[[@B18]\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nThe heart injuries were divided into three categories. Normal structure: the myocardial structure is normal, the cells are closely aligned, the boundaries are clear, and there is no obvious degeneration, congestion, and edema. Moderate structure injury: the myocardial arrangement was slightly irregular, the myocardial cells were swollen, the myocardial hyperemic edema was visible, and a small amount of lymphocyte infiltration was visible. Serious structure injury: The injury shows loose arrangement of myocardial cell, irregular part of the myocardial fiber fracture, apparent vacuole degeneration, height of myocardial interstitial hyperemia and edema, and a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration.\\\\n\\\\n2.6. Statistical Analysis {#sec2.6}\\\\n-------------------------\\\\n\\\\nAll data are expressed as means\\\\u2009\\\\u00b1\\\\u2009SE. A one-way analysis of variance was used to assess the overall difference between groups. A value of *P* \\\\\\\\< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\\\\n\\\\n3. Results {#sec3}\\\\n==========\\\\n\\\\n3.1. Baseline Parameters {#sec3.1}\\\\n------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIn this study, body weight over the course of the 12-week treatment period was elevated in both CD and WD groups. In addition, body weight in the WD group increased more significantly than that in the CD group (*P* \\\\\\\\< 0.01, [Table 1](#tab1){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). SIT treatment significantly reduced the elevation of body weight in the WD\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009SIT group (*P* \\\\\\\\< 0.05). Body weight and % of body weight gain did not differ between CD and CD\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009SIT groups after treatment (*P* \\\\\\\\> 0.05).\\\\n\\\\n3.2. Metabolic Parameters {#sec3.2}\\\\n-------------------------\\\\n\\\\nLiver weight, plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were similarly elevated in the WD group, indicating lipidemia and liver impairment in WD mice ([Table 1](#tab1){ref-type=\\\\\"table\\\\\"}). Liver weight elevation in WD mice was not reduced by SIT treatment. SIT treatment decreased the elevation of cholesterol, triglycerides, and ALT in WD mice (*P* \\\\\\\\< 0.05).\\\\n\\\\n3.3. Glucose Homeostasis Parameters {#sec3.3}\\\\n-----------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nBaseline fasting glucose and HbA1c in all groups did not show significant difference at the beginning of the study. At the end of study, WD groups had higher elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c compared to CD groups (Figures [1(a)](#fig1){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"} and [1(b)](#fig1){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}), and the fasting glucose and HbA1c in the WD\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009SIT group were significantly lower compared to those in the WD group (*P* \\\\\\\\< 0.05). However, the values did not return to the normal range. The results indicate that progressing hyperglycemia was ameliorated by SIT. In this study, mice in the WD group had higher plasma insulin concentrations compared to CD group mice (*P* \\\\\\\\< 0.01). SIT also reduced the plasma insulin significantly in the WD\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009SIT group compared to that in the WD group ([Figure 1(c)](#fig1){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}).\\\\n\\\\n3.4. WD-Induced Diastolic Dysfunction Was Improved by SIT {#sec3.4}\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nFemale mice fed with WD for 12 weeks exhibited abnormal echocardiographic diastolic function parameters when compared with CD and CD\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009SIT groups (Figures [2(a)](#fig2){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}--[2(d)](#fig2){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). The MPI, which assesses both systolic and diastolic function, was increased in the WD group, but its impact was greatly decreased by SIT treatment ([Figure 2(a)](#fig2){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). An increase in this parameter is indicative of impaired cardiac function. The increase in MPI in the WD group is likely due to abnormal diastolic function as indicated by both a prolonged period of isovolumic relaxation ([Figure 2(b)](#fig2){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}) and a decrease in mitral inflow Vp ([Figure 2(c)](#fig2){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). The *E*/Vp ratio, a marker of left ventricle filling pressure, was elevated in the WD group compared with CD and CD\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009SIT groups. This further supports the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction ([Figure 2(d)](#fig2){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). SIT treatment effectively decreased this elevation in filling pressure. SIT treatment also significantly ameliorated the impact effects of WD-induced cardiac diastolic function.\\\\n\\\\n3.5. WD-Induced Abnormalities in Myocardial Structure Were Improved by SIT {#sec3.5}\\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe myocardial structure in the CD group and CD\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009SIT group exhibited normal histology. The cells are closely aligned with clear boundaries. They also do not show degeneration, congestion, and edema (Figures [3(a)](#fig3){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"} and [3(b)](#fig3){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). Compared to CD mice, WD mice showed severe myocardial structure injury ([Figure 3(c)](#fig3){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). In the WD\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009SIT group, hearts showed a moderate myocardial structure injury. Overall, there is less evidence of cellular injury than in the WD group ([Figure 3(d)](#fig3){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). The injury of myocardium structure was less severe in WD\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009SIT group mice than that in WD group mice.\\\\n\\\\n3.6. Evaluation of Insulin Signaling in Pancreas {#sec3.6}\\\\n------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIn WD fed mice, progressive *\\\\u03b2*-cell failure leads to overt hyperglycemia. They usually develop obesity and hyperglycemia due to endocrine pancreatic insufficiency \\\\\\\\[[@B19]\\\\\\\\]. Western blot evaluation demonstrated decreased total IRS-1 and IRS-2 and an increased phosphorylated Ser^636^ of IRS-1 and Ser^731^ of IRS-2 in pancreas tissue (Figures [4](#fig4){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"} and [5](#fig5){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). SIT treatment reduced the degradation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 (*P* \\\\\\\\< 0.05) and phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. S6K1 phosphorylation was increased in WD fed mice compared to CD counterparts and was decreased by SIT treatment ([Figure 6](#fig6){ref-type=\\\\\"fig\\\\\"}). Our pancreas tissue data confirmed *\\\\u03b2*-cell dysfunction in the WD fed mouse and demonstrated excessive activation of S6K1 as well as increased abnormal Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, along with degradation of total IRS-1 and IRS-2. Moreover, these alterations were attenuated by SIT treatment.\\\\n\\\\n4. Discussion {#sec4}\\\\n=============\\\\n\\\\nThe aim of the study was to determine whether a 12-week treatment with DPP-4 inhibitor SIT ameliorates overnutrition-induced progression of abnormal cardiac dysfunction and glucose homeostasis in obese female mice. The role of insulin metabolic signaling molecules was also investigated. This study showed that DPP-4 inhibitor SIT improves cardiac diastolic function in female obese mice. This improvement was associated with the protective effect of *\\\\u03b2*-cell function by reductions of mTOR/S6K1 activation, degradation, and serphorylation of INS docking proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2. The results show that targeted pharmacologic interventions with DPP-4 inhibitor could be useful in ameliorating pathophysiologic abnormalities in cardiac diastolic dysfunction and preventing the activation of insulin metabolic signaling molecules through enhanced mTOR/S6K1 activation and Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. This is one mechanism implicated in the pathogenesis of INS resistance in the setting of obesity or diabetes.\\\\n\\\\nChronic overnutrition with a WD resulted in obesity, insulin resistance, and elevated plasma DPP-4 activity as well as heart enlargement and dysfunction \\\\\\\\[[@B20]\\\\\\\\]. Diabetic db/db mice are reported to exhibit increased interstitial fibrosis as early as 2 months of age \\\\\\\\[[@B21]\\\\\\\\]. We observed an improvement in cardiac diastolic function which was associated with reductions in myocardial fiber fracture, apparent vacuole degeneration, myocardial interstitial hyperemia, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration in WD fed mice with SIT administration. Cardiac structure in the WD group was more impaired, and this could be due to the result of stress on the left ventricle wall caused by an increase in left ventricle filling pressure. DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin suppresses reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, and proinflammatory signals and reduces collagen deposition \\\\\\\\[[@B22]\\\\\\\\]. There is growing evidence that a DPP-4 inhibitor could exert cardioprotection and improve left ventricular function by reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis and increasing reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) activity \\\\\\\\[[@B23]\\\\\\\\]. Thus, it is likely that SIT may blunt myocardium injury progression. The underlying mechanism needs to be further investigated.\\\\n\\\\nMultiple metabolic and proliferative pathways implicated in INS resistance lead to Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1. However, the role of the mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway is particularly interesting because it is affected by nutrients and energy status. Studying this pathway allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the role of overnutrition on INS resistance and *\\\\u03b2*-cell failure. Excessive activation of mTOR/S6K1 can also impair INS metabolic signaling through enhanced Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, which targets these molecules for proteosomal degradation. This is a widely accepted mechanism which contributes to the pathogenesis of INS resistance in several tissues, including skeletal muscle \\\\\\\\[[@B24]--[@B26]\\\\\\\\]. Our data in the pancreas tissue confirmed *\\\\u03b2*-cell dysfunction in the WD fed mouse and demonstrated excessive activation of S6K1 as well as increased abnormal Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, along with degradation of IRS-1 and IRS-2. Moreover, these alterations were attenuated by SIT treatment in our obese female mouse model. Other studies have demonstrated increased mTOR/S6K1 activation in the transgenic Zucker obese (ZO) rat \\\\\\\\[[@B2], [@B27]\\\\\\\\], a model of overnutrition and obesity which carries a mutation of the leptin receptor and develops INS resistance and glucose intolerance. This suggested that the mTOR/S6K1 and INS metabolic signaling pathways in the pancreas play an important role in the development and survival of *\\\\u03b2*-cells. S6K1 KO mice have decreased *\\\\u03b2*-cell size and mass, hypoinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance, suggesting a critical participation of this pathway in *\\\\u03b2*-cell survival \\\\\\\\[[@B28]\\\\\\\\]. How DPP-4 inhibitor attenuates the activation of the S6K1 in the setting of overnutrition- and obesity-induced INS resistance as well as its relation to *\\\\u03b2*-cell function is yet fully elucidated.\\\\n\\\\nChronic treatment of WD fed mice with the DPP-4 inhibitor led to marked inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity and improved insulin sensitivity. DPP-4 inhibition may suppress INS resistance with a decrease in body weight but not back to control levels \\\\\\\\[[@B20]\\\\\\\\]. In a fatty liver Shionogi-ob/ob male mouse model, SIT administration reduced body weight, blood glucose levels, and hepatic fibrosis. It also attenuated hepatic stellate cell activation and Kupffer cells \\\\\\\\[[@B29]\\\\\\\\]. Consistent with these studies, we observed the differences in body weight between CD and WD at the end of experiment in our female obesity model. However, in insulin-resistant male ZO rats, DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin treatment for 8 weeks did not alter the body weight during the study period \\\\\\\\[[@B30]\\\\\\\\]. This difference in results may due to the different animal strain used (rat versus mouse; male versus female), as well as different inhibitor and treatment time.\\\\n\\\\nIn our study, food intake or calorie intake was not measured to evaluate whether beneficial effects of SIT could be due to a decrease in food intake or low-calorie intake. A research study demonstrated that SIT attenuated body adiposity, without affecting food intake, in C57BL/6 mice with diet-induced obesity \\\\\\\\[[@B31]\\\\\\\\]. However, in a clinical study patients who were given with SIT 100\\\\u2009mg (oral) daily for 4 weeks, postprandial serum glucagon, fasting blood glucose, and 24-h caloric intake decreased \\\\\\\\[[@B32]\\\\\\\\]. The possibility that SIT exerts its beneficial effects in part via suppression of food intake or low-calorie intake cannot be excluded.\\\\n\\\\nSaxagliptin monotherapy prevented or delayed the progression of impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose to type 2 diabetes mellitus in obese patients with newly diagnosed prediabetes \\\\\\\\[[@B33]\\\\\\\\]. SIT administration decreased ambient blood glucose levels and improved the glucose excursion rate. This was associated with elevated plasma insulin and reduced plasma glucagon levels \\\\\\\\[[@B34]\\\\\\\\]. SIT also decreased circulating DPP-4 activity, improved glucose tolerance, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity, and reduced plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels \\\\\\\\[[@B35]\\\\\\\\]. In the recent study, SIT protected liver tissue, modulated lipid metabolism in a mouse model, and mediated expression levels of key enzymes for lipid metabolism \\\\\\\\[[@B15]\\\\\\\\]. Our results also showed that SIT decreased the elevation of cholesterol, triglycerides, and ALT in the WD group. Given that SIT altered the elevation of cholesterol, triglycerides, and ALT in the WD\\\\u2009+\\\\u2009SIT group compared to the WD group, this indicates that plasma glucose metabolic change may be involved in the improvement effect of SIT on cardiac dysfunction in WD fed female mice. In addition, high-fat fed mice treated with SIT exhibited significant improvement in insulin sensitivity indicating that improvements in glycemic control were not solely a consequence of enhanced insulin secretion \\\\\\\\[[@B36]\\\\\\\\]. The recent study suggested that the protective effects afforded by this DPP-4 inhibitor may derive from improvement of the metabolic profile and from cytoprotective properties \\\\\\\\[[@B37]\\\\\\\\]. In the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, Ferreira et al. have found that chronic SIT treatment corrected the glycemic dysmetabolism, hypertriglyceridemia, inflammation, and hypertension and reduced the severity of the histopathological lesions of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine tissues, together with a favorable redox status, which provides a further advantage in the management of diabetes and its proatherogenic comorbidities \\\\\\\\[[@B38]\\\\\\\\].\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, our study supports a newly described pleiotropic protective effect of DPP-4 inhibitor SIT on diastolic function and *\\\\u03b2*-cell function in the obesity female mouse model. Despite the improvement in glycemic control, the HbA1c and fasting glucose values remained elevated. It is likely that the pleiotropic effects of SIT relate to factors other than improvements in glycemia and lipidemia. These findings suggest a potential clinical utility for SIT in the obesity/diabetic population. However, some limitations exist in the current study, such as pancreas histomorphology could not be done to study the impact of SIT on pancreas lesions and the indirect effect on dysfunction by assessing S6K1, IRS-1, and IRS-2 was not evaluated. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate the potential role of mTOR/SGK1 and INS docking proteins INS receptor substrates 1 and 2 as mediators of the efficacy of SIT on insulin resistance. DPP-4 activity and GLP-1 levels will be also needed to be measured to confirm that chronic overnutrition elevates plasma DPP-4 activity and DPP-4 inhibitor inhibits plasma DPP-4 activity.\\\\n\\\\nThis work was supported by Grants SS201756 (to Dr. Jianzhong An) and SS201613 (to Dr. Chen Wang) from Suzhou Science and Technology Development Plan, NSFC 81703501 (to Dr. Shigang Qiao) from the National Science and Technology Development Plan, QNRC2016219 (to Dr. Shigang Qiao) from Jiangsu Key Talent Youth Awards in Medicine, Gusu Health Youth Talent Awards (to Dr. Shigang Qiao), and 2017Q003 (to Lei Hong) from Suzhou New District Science and Technology Project.\\\\n\\\\nData Availability\\\\n=================\\\\n\\\\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\\\\n\\\\nConflicts of Interest\\\\n=====================\\\\n\\\\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\\\\n\\\\nAuthors\\\\\\\\\\' Contributions\\\\n=======================\\\\n\\\\nShigang Qiao and Guofang Mao contributed equally to this work.\\\\n\\\\n![WD mice have elevated fasting glucose and HbA1c levels at the end of treatment.

This article should act as a call for the development of formal academic medical fellowship programs to train physicians in the practice of cellular and regenerative medicine. The USA is used here as an example of a medical sphere in which it can be argued that such training would be helpful, however such programs would be quite helpful globally.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"Pile-CC\"}}',\n",
       " '{\"text\": \"The present invention relates to pallet-making machines in general, and in particular to nail-driving chucks for use in pallet-making machines.\\\\nThe forerunners of today\\'s wooden pallets were developed during World War II to assist the armed forces in moving large amounts of goods in short time periods with forklift trucks. Wooden pallet usage has increased explosively since that time.\\\\nAutomated pallet-making machines were developed in response to the high demand for wood pallets and now occupy an important position in the pallet manufacturing industry. The primary function of these pallet-making machines is the automatic nailing of pallet boards which have been positioned either manually or with some assistance from the pallet-making machine.\\\\nAutomated pallet-making machines often use drive pins or rams to drive nails being held by a chuck into boards located below the chuck. Nails driven into the component boards of a pallet must be countersunk so that the nail heads do not protrude above the top surface of the boards. Countersinking is important because bags or packages containing goods which are placed on pallets can be torn by nail heads protruding above the boards.\\\\nDepending upon the pallet buyer\\'s specifications, pallet manufacturers countersink the top of the nails to different depths below the top surface of the pallet boards. This change in countersink depth has traditionally been made by changing the relative distance between the board end of the nailing chuck and the drive end of the nailing chuck so that the pin\\'s final extended position of the nail-driving pin is changed relative to the board end of the nailing chuck.\\\\nAn example of such a countersink adjustment apparatus is shown in the Wallin U.S. Pat. No. 4,782,989. In the Wallin patent the board end of the nailing chuck and the drive end of the nailing chuck are connected together by threads. The drive end of the nailing chuck contains female threads and the board end of the nailing chuck contains male threads. Where the drive end and the board end connect, a female threaded lock ring selectively locks the board end of the nailing chuck in position. The drive end of the nailing chuck is independently fastened in place so that the drive end cannot rotate about the longitudinal axis of the nailing chuck.\\\\nThe board end of the chuck can be selectively rotated about the longitudinal axis of the nailing chuck while connected to the drive end of the chuck to change the relative distance from the board end of the chuck to the drive end of the chuck. The nail-driving pin is connected to the drive end of the chuck and extends into the board end of the chuck. When the distance from the board end of the chuck to the drive end of the chuck is changed, the position of the nail-driving pin, relative to the board end of the chuck, is also changed since the position of the nail-driving pin is fixed relative to the drive end of the chuck. Consequently, by changing the position of the board end of the chuck relative to the drive end of the chuck, the final extended position of the nail-driving pin can be adjusted relative to the board end of the chuck, and the nail countersink depth can be selectively changed.\\\\nOne complication of this nail countersink depth adjustment method is that automatic nail feeding devices are often connected to the board end of the chuck. Since the board end of the chuck must be rotated to adjust the countersink depth, the automatic nail feeding device must be removed from the board end of the chuck prior to its adjustment and must be reattached following adjustment of the countersink depth. Since the automatic pallet-making machinery does not operate when the chuck is not operating, pallet making is suspended during the time required for removing and reattaching the automatic nail feeding equipment to the board end of the chuck and during the relatively short period of time required for actual adjustment of the board end of the chuck relative to the drive end of the chuck.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"USPTO Backgrounds\"}}',\n",
       " '{\"text\": \"Ictal autoscopic phenomena and near death experiences: a study of five patients with ictal autoscopies.\\\\nAutoscopic phenomena in general may-among other conditions-occur during epileptic seizures and near death experiences. We set the hypothesis that ictal autoscopic phenomena and near death experiences have a similar semiology as measured by the Near Death Experience Questionnaire. We also investigated whether patients with aura before temporal lobe seizures with or without autoscopic phenomena could be distinguished by this questionnaire. For these purposes, we examined five patients with ictal autoscopy and 12 patients with aura before temporal lobe seizures without ictal autoscopy as controls. We used a cut-off of 7 points or higher on the Near Death Experience Questionnaire for indicating the semiology of a near death experience and for distinguishing patients with ictal autoscopy from controls. This cut-off separated patients with ictal autoscopic phenomena from aura before temporal lobe seizures without autoscopy (p = 0.0002, two-sided, exact Fisher\\'s Test; specificity: 100 % [CI95 % 77.9 and 100 %], sensitivity: 100 % [CI95 % 54.9 and 100 %]). Furthermore, all autoscopic patients (range 7-10) and none of the controls (range 0-5) had scores of 7 points or higher. Thus, the individual experiences during simple partial autoscopic seizures and near death experiences are similar, at least in some prominent aspects. These findings might be of particular interest for the pathophysiology of near death experiences, as all patients with ictal autoscopic phenomena had an epileptic dysfunction at the temporo-parietal junction or its neighboring regions. Therefore, a malfunction of this brain region might also be involved in near death experiences of other origins especially during states which could cause a near death experience and a cerebral excitability.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"PubMed Abstracts\"}}',\n",

Gait changes commonly result from these combined factors. This study aimed to examine the effects of knee extension strength, visual acuity, and knee joint pain on gait properties of for 181 healthy female older adults (age: 76.1 (5.7) years). Walking speed, cadence, stance time, swing time, double support time, step length, step width, walking angle, and toe angle were selected as gait parameters. Knee extension strength was measured by isometric dynamometry; and decreased visual acuity and knee joint pain were evaluated by subjective judgment whether or not such factors created a hindrance during walking. Among older adults without vision problems and knee joint pain that affected walking, those with superior knee extension strength had significantly greater walking speed and step length than those with inferior knee extension strength (P < .05). Persons with visual acuity problems had higher cadence and shorter stance time. In addition, persons with pain in both knees showed slower walking speed and longer stance time and double support time. A decrease of knee extension strength and visual acuity and knee joint pain are factors affecting gait in the female older adults. Decreased knee extension strength and knee joint pain mainly affect respective distance and time parameters of the gait.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"PubMed Abstracts\"}}',\n",
       " '{\"text\": \"Obamacare: Still stupid after all these years\\\\n\\\\nThere\\'s something about Obamacare that really shines a light on the stupid. And by that I mean stupid politicians, stupid \\\\\"experts,\\\\\" and even regular \\\\u2013 but stupid - Americans. And in case you missed it, the last few weeks have presented us, and the presidential candidates, with more solid evidence of ACA-related stupidity than usual. Let\\'s look at the top three contenders on the Obamacare Stupid Bowl \\'16:\\\\n\\\\nFirst, we now know that Obamacare enrollment has fallen short by 24 million people. The real number of enrolled Americans in ACA plans is 11.1 million. Making matters worse is the fact that a major chunk of the people not signing up are the younger and healthier Americans the ACA\\'s architects were foolishly relying on to help absorb the costs from older and sicker enrollees. This is the continuing development that many call the \\\\\"Obamacare Death Spiral.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSecond, so many Insurance companies are curtailing their participation in Obamacare exchanges that 31 percent of U.S. counties are likely to have just one insurance company option for health coverage by next year. That\\'s what we call a monopoly. And in case you don\\'t know how dangerous monopolies can be in health care, Google the words \\\\\"Mylan\\\\\" and \\\\\"EpiPen\\\\\" when you get a chance.\\\\n\\\\nThird, and getting back to the weak enrollment numbers, this summer we learned that one of the biggest reasons people are refusing to sign up for Obamacare is\\\\u2026 they want to keep smoking. The higher surcharges and premiums for smokers are discouraging people, especially young people, from enrolling in ACA plans. And, it turns out that these higher costs aren\\'t encouraging them to quit smoking either. Oh, and there\\'s also still evidence that a decent percentage of people who do sign up for Obamacare who say they\\'re not smokers are lying. This last one is a triple dose of stupid all on its own.\\\\n\\\\nThe stupid response from our two leading presidential candidates has been predictable and constant. Donald Trump keeps promising to repeal Obamacare, but he offers no further specifics. This is stupid, especially for a candidate who\\'s otherwise been pretty good at focusing on one single aspect of a policy he doesn\\'t like and also making clear, (if questionable), promises about what he\\'d do to change them. Hillary Clinton is barely talking about Obamacare at all.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"This summer we learned that one of the biggest reasons people are refusing to sign up for Obamacare is\\\\u2026 they want to keep smoking.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe ACA\\'s continuing inability to attain even a 50 percent approval rating in the polls is likely the reason, along with an intense Clinton campaign fear of even appearing to criticize President Obama. But it\\'s simply stupid for Clinton not to point out that Obamacare has failed to live up to some of its most crucial promises. Her unwillingness to do so leaves the door wide open for Trump to score major points on this issue if he ever hones his message on the ACA.\\\\n\\\\nAll of these emerging issues are fruit of the same stupid source tree a lot of people saw from a mile away well before Obamacare went into effect in the first place. As many who worked in the health care industry tried to tell the politicians who wouldn\\'t listen, we know that a lot of people just won\\'t do the right thing for themselves when it comes to their health care.\\\\n\\\\nThey won\\'t eat right, they won\\'t stop smoking, they won\\'t exercise, they won\\'t visit a doctor regularly, and they sure as heck aren\\'t going to sign up for health insurance coverage unless they need it right away. In short, the ACA was set up to rely the most on the most tragically unreliable people in the country. Some of those people are rich, some of those people are poor.\\\\n\\\\nMore of them are younger, but a decent number of them are over 30. Do they have a right not to sign up for government-mandated health insurance? Absolutely they do. But let\\'s pretend we all agree that health care is a human right. If that is the case, then why should Americans who want their health care rights be held hostage by those who don\\'t?\\\\n\\\\nSo, what about all those poor and middle class people who couldn\\'t get health insurance before Obamacare? Was it \\\\\"stupid\\\\\" to try to help them too? Of course not. Setting up a system that helps poor or even middle class people who want and need cheaper health insurance coverage wasn\\'t stupid. But setting up a system that relied way too much on people who don\\'t want and will not sign up for health insurance no matter what was epically stupid, and now we\\'re all paying for it.\\\\n\\\\nAnd don\\'t forget that it\\'s not rich people, or even young and healthy people, who will suffer because of this stupidity. With reduced carrier options for coverage, which means a reduced number of doctors who will accept enrollee insurance plans, and rising costs, it\\'s the people who can least afford to pay for their own coverage who are suffering and will suffer more as current trends continue.\\\\n\\\\nAnd before you yell \\\\\"single payer!\\\\\" remember that a completely government-administered health system would only exacerbate this problem as we wouldn\\'t even be able to penalize those who don\\'t sign up and won\\'t otherwise take care of themselves. Single payer makes all of them the responsibility of the taxpayers forever. And the answer to a growing number of cases of crony capitalism and virtual monopolies in American health care won\\'t be solved by folding them into the biggest and most powerful monopoly of them all: the U.S. government.\\\\n\\\\nA non-stupid alternative would be to keep the best part of Obamacare, which is the idea that you can have the freedom to shop online from a real number of competing choices of health plans. But that would require allowing insurers to cross state lines and that\\'s still not allowed.\\\\n\\\\nIt would also be great to offer more of those bare-boned major medical plans that used to be much more popular among the young and healthy. But the ACA basically banned them. With real competition and real affordability, at least the less stupid among the uninsured would finally sign up.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a brief time in American politics when candidates could score points by promising to stand up for those who worked the hardest and were the most responsible with their finances, their families, and their personal health. The ACA and Trump and Clinton tell us that we now have, and are likely will continue to have, a national health insurance policy given to us by a government of the stupid, by the stupid, and for the stupid.\\\\n\\\\nCommentary by Jake Novak, a senior columnist for CNBC.com.

       " '{\"text\": \"Surface-governed molecular regulation of blood coagulation.\\\\nAmong extracellular biological processes the spatial control of blood clotting is a unique phenomenon. Localization in space has very important consequences in both normal and pathological conditions. Under physiological circumstances a clot is formed only in the vicinity of injury, albeit the prerequisites of coagulation are almost completely given in the whole circulation. The local character of blood clotting is secured by the following major conditions: The regulatory signal initiating coagulation-the damaged vascular wall-is itself a surface on which the majority of clotting reactions take place. The first enzyme, factor XII, of the intrinsic coagulation pathway is activated on the collagen fibers exposed in the damaged vascular wall, although the significance of this reaction in respect of the clotting process is ambiguous. On the membrane of platelets adhered to the damaged blood vessel is activated factor XI, too, which is a well-established participant of the intrinsic clotting process. The further consecutive reactions of coagulation are confined to the surface produced by injury, because the enzymes involved contain gamma-carboxyl-glutamyl side chains which are anchored through calcium bridges to the phospholipids of the platelet membrane. The last enzyme of the sequence is thrombin, which is released from the surface. The reactions taking place on the surface form an enzyme cascade, which amplifies the relatively weak triggering signal by several orders of magnitudes. Amplification is ensured not only by the enzyme-substrate relationship of the consecutive reaction partners, but also by spatial confinement, which endows the process with higher efficacy than could be expected on a statistical basis from reactions in solution. It contributes to the efficiency of enzyme cascade that the non-enzymatic regulatory proteins increase the activity of factors IXa and Xa, and thereby the overall process. While the partner of factor IXa, factor VIII, is captured from plasma, factor V, the partner of factor Xa, is derived from the platelets adhered to the damaged surface and orients the binding of factor Xa. The surface localization ensures the protection of the members of clotting system: In the activator complexes found on the surface, the spatial arrangement of clotting factors prevents the inactivation of factors by physiological inhibitors or by proteolytic enzymes and specific antibodies that appear in the circulation in pathological conditions. Platelet factor 4, derived from platelets, binds heparin and thereby markedly decreases the reactivity of antithrombin III, the physiological inhibitor of clotting factors.

We examined the presence of the Hedgehog pathway in normal and pathological human colon tissue. Components investigated include Sonic (Shh), Indian (Ihh), and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh), Gli1, Gli2, Gli3, and Patched (Ptch). Pathological tissue samples comprised 23 benign and 20 malignant lesions of human colon. The influence of the Hedgehog pathway on differentiation and proliferation has been investigated by analyzing the effect of the pathway inhibitor Cyclopamine on human colon cancer cell lines HT29 and CaCo2. In normal colon, we detected expression of Shh and Dhh within the lining epithelium and Patched, Gli1, and Gli2 along the whole crypts. Within all benign lesions, positive staining of Shh, Dhh, Gli1, Gli2, and Ptch was detected. Expression of Shh and Dhh was restricted to single cell aggregates. Malignant lesions also displayed focal staining pattern for Shh and Dhh but to a much lesser extent.

A clinical trial was performed at the Al-Zahra Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, from July 2017 to January 2018. Based on the inclusion criteria, 104 post-CABG patients were recruited into the study. The participants were randomly assigned to the intervention (OCR) group (n = 52) or the usual care group (n = 52). The intervention group received 20 sessions of OCR, whereas the usual care group received the routine hospital care and education.

Version 2.0 of the protocol was released in 2002; the document was last updated in 2015. It has a Creative Commons license BY-SA.\\\\n\\\\nHistory\\\\n\\\\nIn the late 1990s, Herbert Van de Sompel (Ghent University) was working with researchers and librarians at Los Alamos National Laboratory (US) and called a meeting to address difficulties related to interoperability issues of e-print servers and digital repositories. The meeting was held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in October 1999. A key development from the meeting was the definition of an interface that permitted e-print servers to expose metadata for the papers it held in a structured fashion so other repositories could identify and copy papers of interest with each other. This interface/protocol was named the \\\\\"Santa Fe Convention\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nSeveral workshops were held in 2000 at the ACM Digital Libraries conference and elsewhere to share the ideas from the Santa Fe Convention. It was discovered at the workshops that the problems faced by the e-print community were also shared by libraries, museums, journal publishers, and others who needed to share distributed resources. To address these needs, the Coalition for Networked Information and the Digital Library Federation provided funding to establish an Open Archives Initiative (OAI) secretariat managed by Herbert Van de Sompel and Carl Lagoze. The OAI held a meeting at Cornell University (Ithaca, New York) in September 2000 to improve the interface developed at the Santa Fe Convention. The specifications were refined over e-mail.\\\\n\\\\nOAI-PMH version 1.0 was introduced to the public in January 2001 at a workshop in Washington D.C., and another in February in Berlin, Germany. Subsequent modifications to the XML standard by the W3C required making minor modifications to OAI-PMH resulting in version 1.1. The current version, 2.0, was released in June 2002. It contained several technical changes and enhancements and is not backward compatible.\\\\n\\\\nRegistries\\\\nThe OAI Protocol was adopted by many digital libraries, institutional repositories, and digital archives.

Google initially included support for OAI-PMH when launching sitemaps, however decided to support only the standard XML Sitemaps format in May 2008. In 2004, Yahoo! acquired content from OAIster (University of Michigan) that was obtained through metadata harvesting with OAI-PMH. Wikimedia uses an OAI-PMH repository to provide feeds of Wikipedia and related site updates for search engines and other bulk analysis/republishing endeavors. Especially when dealing with thousands of files being harvested every day, OAI-PMH can help in reducing the network traffic and other resource usage by doing incremental harvesting. NASA\\'s Mercury metadata search system uses OAI-PMH to index thousands of metadata records from Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) every day.\\\\n\\\\nThe mod_oai project is using OAI-PMH to expose content to web crawlers that is accessible from Apache Web servers.\\\\n\\\\nSoftware\\\\nOAI-PMH is based on a client\\\\u2013server architecture, in which \\\\\"harvesters\\\\\" request information on updated records from \\\\\"repositories\\\\\".

It had some great images that I will go back to and incorporate into lessons and presentations. By asking you to give credit to the source, it reminds faculty that just because it\\\\u2019s for education, doesn\\\\u2019t mean you don\\\\u2019t have to give credit (and it is also serves as an example to students when they see you giving credit). the following was my post:\\\\n\\\\n@ontarioextend#oext13 \\\\u2013 I care about my students and am always thinking about new ways to reach and engage them. Because of this, I don\\\\u2019t get enough sleep and need my coffee to wake up every morning. All this can stress me out\\\\u2026.just a bit\\\\u2026#extendmOOC\\\\n\\\\nThe third one I chose was #oext123. This daily activity brought in the curation and collaboration modules. We collaborated by curating a list of videos on how and why to use ed-tech tools. I actually did 2 posts for this one.\\\\n\\\\nI found a great video on one of my favourite tools (Socrative). My post on Twitter:\\\\n\\\\nWhat is Tagboard?\\\\n\\\\nTagboard is a really useful tool for finding tweets about various topics (based on the hashtag you use). It allows you to see tweets in a more visual way that looks almost like a Padlet wall.\\\\n\\\\nOur school is taking a deeper look into Micro-credentials, so I decided to make a tagboard that would find any reference to micro-credentials on Twitter using the hashtag #microcredentials. There were some very interesting posts that I will be exploring further. Link: https://tagboard.com/microcredentials/480738\\\\n\\\\nLast week, I was in an online workshop on digital badges and they were talking about how using digital badges to show skills is important in bridging the gap between what employers are looking for and the skills candidates have.\\\\n\\\\nThis was one of my favourites posts and it confirms what they said in the workshop:\\\\n\\\\nThis tool allowed me to quickly search posts about specific topics. In this case, it lead me to articles and people who are interested in the topic.\\\\n\\\\nThis is an awesome tool that I plan to use from now on!\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I think this may be one of my favourite modules. I\\\\u2019ve never been afraid to try new things when it comes to technology. I like to bring the students along for the ride and get their input. Sometimes we (teachers) think we know what a student will like or find intuitive. It\\\\u2019s important to get them involved in the process. I find that when they are, those are the activities that are embraced by the students the most.\\\\n\\\\nIf you look both the diagram and the definition, we are still looking for some of the same skills that we always have, only now we focus on the utilization of technology to achieve the task. For example, one element: \\\\u201cCommunications and collaboration. Participate in digital networks for learning and research\\\\u201d. Just because we have technology available to better communicate/collaborate, doesn\\\\u2019t mean we didn\\\\u2019t expect students to be able to communicate before technology was around. Technology has changed the way we communicate and hence, students need to be able to communicate this way. Collaboration once meant that students would have to get together physically in order to collaborate on projects. Now they can do it all virtually and don\\\\u2019t even have to be in the same time zone.\\\\n\\\\nAs teachers, we can help our students to become more digitally literate by demonstrating effective technology use and/or incorporating it into our assignments. E.g. Utilizing a simulation to enhance understanding and application of subject material. The All Aboard: Digital Skills in Higher Education resource listed some specific examples of what can be utilized. For example, under \\\\u201cTeach and Learn\\\\u201d, things like simulations, digital badges, lecture capture etc. are listed.\\\\n\\\\nQuite often, when we hear the words \\\\u201cdigital literacy\\\\u201d, we think of knowing how to use a computer. Too often we assume that because students are \\\\u201cdigital natives\\\\u201d that it also means they know how to utilize digital tools effectively. I have found that most of the times this is not the case.\\\\n\\\\nHow many times have you, as a teacher, stood at the front of the classroom and asked: \\\\u201cany questions?\\\\u201d And how many of those times have you been met with blank stares, and silence? Have you, like me, resorted to a \\\\u201cFerris Bueller\\\\u201d reference: \\\\u201cAnyone\\\\u2026? Anyone\\\\u2026? Bueller\\\\u2026? Bueller\\\\u2026?\\\\u201d only to be met, yet again, with blank stares from the much-younger-than-you-even-think-they-are, born in the post-Bueller era, students in the room?\\\\n\\\\nThis nugget resonated with me because I know if I ask my students, \\\\u201cany questions\\\\u201d, most of the time, I will get the same response that the teacher in Ferris Bueller\\\\u2019s Day Off did; blank stares. Sometimes, just to see who\\\\u2019s actually listening, I\\\\u2019ve said the exact thing from the movie: \\\\u201dAnyone\\\\u2026? Anyone\\\\u2026? Bueller\\\\u2026?\\\\u201d and I get laughter (and the occasional student who has never seen the movie). At the very least, it gets students smiling.\\\\n\\\\nI learned a long time ago that I needed other ways to check how students were doing. For many of them, asking if there are any questions scares them and they stay silent rather than speak. They think they are the \\\\u201conly one\\\\u201d that doesn\\\\u2019t understand.\\\\n\\\\nA number of years ago, I received a grant as part of the HP Catalyst Initiative for a Math project that I proposed. We received 50 touchscreen PC computers and some money to utilize them in my Business Math classes. Each student had a laptop to use in the class and my notes were broadcast out to each device. They saw everything I wrote on their devices as I wrote it. They could add their own notes and save all of it. Two of the best features were the \\\\u201cstop light\\\\u201d and the ability for students to work on a question and \\\\u2018send\\\\u2019 it back to me.\\\\n\\\\nPhoto by Davis Sanchez on Pexels.com\\\\n\\\\nThe stop light was simple. With a press of a button, I could ask the students if they understood the material (Green), were somewhat confused (yellow) or they didn\\\\u2019t understand (Red). It was quick and no one else knew what they answered except me. There was one instance where \\\\u00bd of them didn\\\\u2019t understand the material. When I mentioned this, all of a sudden, hands went up. Realizing that they were not the only one confused gave students the confidence to ask questions. We reviewed the material and were able to move on and not leave anyone behind.\\\\n\\\\nThe other feature allowed me to push out a question to the students, and the students could answer it and send it back to me. Since this was a math question and they had touch screen devices with pens, they could write their answers just like they would on a piece of paper. This gave me the ability to see in detail what they were thinking when answering questions and I could address any issues through feedback that I could write on their submission and send back to them. I could also choose a solution that was correct and display it for the whole class (without a name).\\\\n\\\\nWhen I moved to a classroom that did not have these devices, I had to find new ways to accomplish the same thing. I turned to Socrative to help me get quick feedback on how students were doing. Most students download the app which makes it quick and easy to use. At the beginning of each class, I give students a quick poll with some questions that are based on the lesson from the previous class. I take up the questions they have issues with before moving on. I can see who is having trouble and can use that information to give more individual help as well.\\\\n\\\\nPhoto by freestocks.org on Pexels.com\\\\n\\\\nI would like to find another tool that would allow me to see their process when solving problems. Since most, if not all, students have a smart phone, I was considering using something like Flipgrid to get them to video themselves solving a problem. Another one I\\\\u2019d like to try is goformative.\\\\n\\\\nI will have to do some testing to see what works and get feedback from the students on what they liked. I find involving the students in the decision adds to the buy in. That\\\\u2019s how I settled on Socrative. We tried a few things and they told me they liked Socrative the best.\\\\n\\\\nEvery class I would hear \\\\u201care we doing a Socrative today miss?\\\\u201d There\\\\u2019s nothing better than having students look forward to doing math!!\\\\n\\\\nThis is post is my submission for the Ontario Extend MOOC Activity: Like Driving a Car\\\\n\\\\nMany concepts I teach build on other concepts learned at the beginning of the course, or on concepts that should have been learned in grade school or high school. Because so many students come with a variety of backgrounds, we find we have to teach concepts such as Order of Operations, exponents and fractions.\\\\n\\\\nThere are many examples I could use. But I am working on one example in my Business Math 2 course that demonstrates this point.\\\\n\\\\nStudents have been working with the compound interest formula\\\\n\\\\nTo work with the formula, the need to understand\\\\n\\\\nWhat each operation/symbol means\\\\n\\\\nOrder of operations\\\\n\\\\nExponents\\\\n\\\\nHow to use the exponent button in their calculator\\\\n\\\\nWe are now moving on to finding i\\\\n\\\\nIn order to isolate i in the equation, they need to\\\\n\\\\nbe able to apply algebraic skills to rearrange the formula.\\\\n\\\\nknow how to take the nth root (and that this is how they can get rid of the exponent)\\\\n\\\\nunderstand that they need to do the correct operations in the right order\\\\n\\\\nThis is just one concept that depends on understanding previously learned material.\\\\n\\\\nI believe that many students struggle in math because they don\\\\u2019t understand the basics. Applying this to more complicated problems is very difficult if they don\\\\u2019t have the foundation they need.\\\\n\\\\nThis is the last 9x9x25 post and its nice that it aligns closely with the end of the Fall term. It provides an opportunity to reflect on the entire term as we prepare for the end of semester and look toward the holidays and some much deserved time off.\\\\n\\\\nThere have been lots of ups and downs this semester. I\\\\u2019ve had a number of challenges trying to motivate students to not only come to class, but stay and participate. I\\\\u2019ve also had some great successes where I saw students actively participating and having fun with math.\\\\n\\\\nI have found this time writing blog posts for the 9x9x25 challenge a great way to reflect on my teaching in a different way than I am used to. So often, reflecting means looking at how the class went, making notes for next time and moving on. It\\\\u2019s a personal process and it\\\\u2019s usually not shared with others.\\\\n\\\\nBy taking time each week to write a post, that process became a shared process, especially when others responded through comments. I know it thrilled me when JR reflected on my post. And this week, I found Prof Mel\\\\u2019s post about HyFlex (which I made sure to Like). I am interested in exploring it at our school and should we move ahead, I know one person I will reach out to.\\\\n\\\\nThe only thing I wish I could have done better is reading more of the 9x9x25 posts. There are so many wonderful posts, it\\\\u2019s hard to read them all!\\\\n\\\\nI do have one suggestion for future Challenges (and I hope there will be more).\\\\n\\\\nI would like to see more interaction between participants. I am not sure how that would be accomplished. One thought \\\\u2013 one or two of the posts we do should have to be as a response to another?\\\\n\\\\nThis has been a very interesting journey and I am glad I took the time to do it.\\\\n\\\\nNow it\\\\u2019s time to start thinking about the next term.\\\\n\\\\nA New Year\\\\u2026 A New Term\\\\u2026\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve got lots of plans for this winter, both personal and professional.\\\\n\\\\nI will be teaching my first full online course this winter. This is a course I have been working with our Online Learning Center to develop since January and it\\\\u2019s finally going live this Winter. I am very excited and nervous at the same time. I\\\\u2019ve taught hybrid courses before, but never fully online.\\\\n\\\\nI am looking forward to starting the @OntarioExtend #ExtendmOOC in January! I\\\\u2019ve enjoyed taking part in the PD offerings through Ontario Extend over the past 7-8 months. I\\\\u2019ve learned so much and \\\\u201cmet\\\\u201d (virtually) some great people.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the highlights of my term will be heading back to Arizona to meet up with the people I have been working with on the ShapingEDU project. The 10 Actions to Shape the Future of Learning that were identified last year are pictured above. If you are interested in the future of learning in the digital age, check out https://shapingedu.asu.edu/home\\\\n\\\\nAnd of course, the winter also brings with it \\\\u2013 Ski Season! I get to spend my weekends enjoying the great outdoors with my winter family at Alpine Ski Club in Collingwood.\\\\n\\\\n9x9x25 Post #8\\\\n\\\\nThis week\\\\u2019s post is not really teaching related. It\\\\u2019s about balance. Balancing our work life and home life so that we can bring the best of ourselves to our teaching.\\\\n\\\\nSometimes we get so busy with our teaching; prepping, marking, answering emails, lesson plans, helping students etc. that we don\\\\u2019t take time for ourselves. I am guilty of doing this.\\\\n\\\\nTaking the time to do something that we enjoy and makes us happy, keeps us balanced.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve become very unbalanced over the years.\\\\n\\\\nMaybe that\\\\u2019s why I decided to take this challenge. It\\\\u2019s making me do something new and I am really enjoying it.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I first started teaching, I always made time for my crafts, especially scrapbooking and card making. I used to call it my right brain activity that kept my life balanced. I teach mostly math and computers, two activities I associate with being left brain activities.\\\\n\\\\nI know there\\\\u2019s research indicating that there is no left or right brain, but I can\\\\u2019t help but think there\\\\u2019s something more to it. There may not be a \\\\u201cleft\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cright\\\\u201d brained activity, but I do believe that activities fall into different types of categories (logical, creative, etc.). For me, when I do something that\\\\u2019s more creative and is different than the numerical and logical things I do every day, I feel I\\\\u2019m a more balanced as a person. I think it also helps me be more creative in my profession as it helps me to find creative solutions to problems in my classroom.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, I have gotten away from using my creative side. Perhaps it\\\\u2019s because I have more responsibilities outside of work than I used to and they are taking up my spare time. My mom passed away 4.5 years ago and my siblings and I have taken over my dad\\\\u2019s care. He just turned 90 last April. I think this (and getting older) has also contributed to an increasing stress level which in turn has created other problems.\\\\n\\\\nIn August I decided to start taking care of me. I still help take care of my dad and do all the other things on my plate, but now I also make time for me. I\\\\u2019ve cut out processed foods, gluten, dairy and sugar and limit my wine. I feel so much better.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve also decided to make a conscious effort to put creativity back into my life. I signed up for a pottery class for this Friday, a couple of paint classes (chalk paint) and starting in January my friend and I will be taking a 10-week pottery course.\\\\n\\\\nI am also looking forward to dusting off my DSLR camera to get some great winter shots up at the ski hill. I could write a ton about how much joining Alpine Ski Club has meant to me and my family (https://alpineskiclub.com). But that\\\\u2019s another post for another day.\\\\n\\\\nI find when I take the time to do the things I love, I feel better, I am more positive and I think that helps me be more positive with my students\\\\n\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s lots of research about the benefits of crafts.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the University of California, Berkeley, a few of the benefits of crafting include:\\\\n\\\\nWho doesn\\\\u2019t want to feel better and keep their mind sharp? Being more creative doesn\\\\u2019t have to be limited to knitting, crocheting or sewing\\\\u2026There are lots of ways to de-stress and head off cognitive decline.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cThere\\\\u2019s promising evidence coming out to support what a lot of crafters have known anecdotally for quite some time,\\\\u201d says Catherine Carey Levisay, a clinical neuropsychologist and wife of Craftsy.com CEO John Levisay. \\\\u201cAnd that\\\\u2019s that creating \\\\u2014 whether it be through art, music, cooking, quilting, sewing, drawing, photography (or) cake decorating \\\\u2014 is beneficial to us in a number of important ways.\\\\u201d (https://www.cnn.com/2014/03/25/health/brain-crafting-benefits/index.html)\\\\n\\\\nThe other class was quiet, but only because it had very poor attendance. The students were quick to tell me that they had two tests that day and because of that, many of the students were not attending so they could study. I thanked them for choosing to come to class.\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps that should be the focus of this week\\\\u2019s blog post.\\\\n\\\\nI had 25% of the students show up for that class this week. Yes, 25%.\\\\n\\\\nI think the ones that attended class came because they clearly recognize that skipping one class to study for another doesn\\\\u2019t help. They knew that they would get behind in the course material and end up playing catch-up.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, most of the students that skipped the class are the ones that are already struggling and needed to be there. Because of this, I made sure that I posted a notice outlining what we covered and gave direction on how they could catch up and be ready for next class.\\\\n\\\\nI even posted a video covering the material so they didn\\\\u2019t have to try and learn it themselves.\\\\n\\\\nI emphasized that because they missed class, they would need to catch up on their own and that we would be moving to the next topic on Tuesday. As an incentive, I told them we\\\\u2019d be having an in-class assignment on last week\\\\u2019s material.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019m not sure how many of them will actually do the work. That\\\\u2019s the bigger problem. If they can\\\\u2019t manage their time well enough to be prepared for a test (and have to skip class to study) are they going to take the time to do the work to learn the missed material? At the time I wrote this, 10 people had gone to the page with the video link. That\\\\u2019s 25% of the class. Most of them were in class that day and were obviously using it to review.\\\\n\\\\nSo how do I get those kids to understand that skipping class is not a good idea AND that THEY are responsible for making up the work?\\\\n\\\\nThose that attended already get it so saying anything to them is pointless.\\\\n\\\\nI did some quick research (Google) and it was interesting that many of the posts I found about skipping class were written by students. One article I found on Students.org, (\\\\u201cIs It Worth It To Skip Class To Study?\\\\u201d) was a first-person account of skipping a class to study. The author made some great points. She said it herself: \\\\u201cSkipping class meant missing out on a lot of knowledge I\\\\u2019d need for future tests\\\\u201d. She went on to talk about the anxiety that goes along with trying to make sure she got the notes and anything else she missed. Her conclusion: She doesn\\\\u2019t recommending skipping class.\\\\n\\\\nThis is what I try and get across to my students, but so few of them believe it.\\\\n\\\\nSkipping class has become an epidemic. When I first started teaching, students rarely skipped class. It was a small percentage. Now, it seems even in-class assignments aren\\\\u2019t enough to entice students. I know things have changed.\\\\n\\\\nMany students have too many competing priorities. For example, they take on too many hours at their jobs. Instead of a part time job, they\\\\u2019re trying to work 30-40 hours and go to school full-time. The sad part is, some of them end up failing because they can\\\\u2019t put enough time into their schoolwork and end up paying more in the long run.\\\\n\\\\nI think the other problem is that some of the students are just not mature enough to realize that attendance is important. I can\\\\u2019t count how many times I have heard \\\\u201cDid I miss anything important?\\\\u201d. Really?\\\\n\\\\nI found post that listed the top 5 reasons why students skipped class (as tracked through their social media posts)\\\\n\\\\nHanging with Friends:37 percent of the Twitter posts referenced skipping class to spend more time with their friends.\\\\n\\\\nToo Tired:32 percent of students tweeted that they were sleeping or too tired to go to class.\\\\n\\\\nRecreation:17 percent of students indicated a specific recreational event or activity that took precedence over attending class. There were a vast number of specific events mentioned, including sports, watching television and playing video games.\\\\n\\\\nStudying:11 percent of students mentioned being too busy with other school work to attend class.\\\\n\\\\nThe article went on to say: \\\\u201cStudies show that class attendance is the number one predictor of grades in a college course, outranking time spent studying, studying skills, high school grades or standardized tests. Despite this clear connection, even the most optimistic academic studies find that nearly one in five U.S. college students are skipping on any given day\\\\u2014with absentee rates reaching up to 70 percent for some large classes at major state universities.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAlthough they didn\\\\u2019t list where those studies came from, results from my own classes have shown a similar thing. Below is an example from one of my previous classes. Some of the students in this particular class who don\\\\u2019t show up initially, never showed up. However, the graph does show that as attendance goes down, the average grade on the tests have also gone down. I show the students this chart every term in hopes that it might make them think twice before skipping class.\\\\n\\\\nThis past week I had a student come to me within issue. Let\\\\u2019s call her \\\\u201cJane\\\\u201d. Jane was not going to be able to make class today and wanted to find out what she was going to miss. Jane\\\\u2019s a good student and I know it was bothering her she wasn\\\\u2019t going to be able to be in class. I told her that if she had any problems, she could email me an we could either meet or do an online help session.\\\\n\\\\nI do online help sessions using a variety of different programs. I have recently started using Zoom. It\\\\u2019s easy to use and since I have a Surface Pro which has a touch screen, I can share my screen and write out the problems in OneNote for students to see while I am explaining them. Jane has attended my online help sessions before, so that gave me an idea.\\\\n\\\\nI asked Jane if she wanted tryout an experiment with me. Just before class started, I opened a Zoom session (https://zoom.us/) and invited her to login. I shared my screen with her and taught the class as I would normally. Jane could hear everything I was saying and was able to follow along with the lesson as I wrote on my laptop.\\\\n\\\\nNormally during an online help session, I would have students post questions to the chat area. In this case, my screen was being shown on the projector. Since I didn\\\\u2019t want to have Jane\\\\u2019s comments broadcast to the entire class, I needed a different tool for questions.\\\\n\\\\nI use Remind (https://www.remind.com/) to send quick text messages to students. This has come in very handy when I can\\\\u2019t get access to the LMS and need to get a message out quick. I can easily send a quick note through the Remind App. It\\\\u2019s a great tool that I have been using for over 5 years. One of the new things it has added over the years is a chat function that allows students to text their teacher without giving away either\\\\u2019s phone number.\\\\n\\\\nFor this lesson, we used the Remind App for questions. She could ask questions (or answer questions I put to the class), but I could also ask her if things were working well from her side or if she had any questions.\\\\n\\\\nEverything worked well and she was so happy that she was able to follow along in the class while she was at home.\\\\n\\\\nI got the idea to try this from an article I had read about HyFlex Course Models. According to an Educause report, \\\\u201cHyFlex is a course design model that presents the components of hybrid learning (which combines face-to-face with online learning) in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both.\\\\u201d (https://library.educause.edu/~/media/files/library/2010/11/eli7066-pdf.pdf )\\\\n\\\\nIn a very rough way, this experiment what is a HyFlex delivery model.\\\\n\\\\nIn the past, HyFlex required expensive technology and a special set up in the classroom.\\\\n\\\\nWith advances in wireless accessibility, software such as Zoom and Tablet PCs which allow writing on the screen, HyFlex isn\\\\u2019t as expensive a venture as it used to be.\\\\n\\\\nThe beauty of HyFlex is that it gives students the ability to choose which model works for them.\\\\n\\\\nFor some students, being in the physical classroom is the best way for them to learn. For others, online, whether it\\\\u2019s in person or watching a video, works just as well.\\\\n\\\\nGiven that the lesson can be recorded, students have the opportunity to review the material if they are still confused or just want a refresher.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve spoken to a professor who used this model and their experience was that 1/3 of students come to class, 1/3 students are online and 1/3 watch the video later. The professor was quite pleased with the HyFlex model.\\\\n\\\\nI believe those that disagree with HyFlex cite that students will just not come to class and some of those students do not have the study skills to do the work at home.\\\\n\\\\nI don\\\\u2019t disagree. Unfortunately, many of those students don\\\\u2019t come to class anyway. At least having a recording gives them an option should they choose to use it.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s hard to believe that this is post #5 for the 9x9x25 challenge. We are past the halfway point!\\\\n\\\\nSince writing (and hence blogging) isn\\\\u2019t my strength, I sometimes find it hard to figure out what to write about. This week I had to look around the other 9x9x25 posts for some inspiration.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have been reading my other posts, you will know I have been having trouble with one particular class. In particular, they are very unfocussed. They would rather sit and wait for me to take up a question, then attempt it on their own (even though I encourage them to work together). Most never do any homework outside of class. They come unprepared for class (some have come to a test with no calculator!!) and then beg for more time or a second chance. Some arrive late for class or leave early.\\\\n\\\\nI am constantly searching for a new ideas I can try. I find myself reading the other 9x9x25 posts (and other blogs) as often as I can for help.\\\\n\\\\nAs I reflected on the past week at school, I found myself both frustrated and energized at the same time.\\\\n\\\\nOne class, continues to frustrate me. Since I\\\\u2019ve already written about them, I will leave that for now.\\\\n\\\\nIn my other class, which is a level 1 foundational math class, we had some fun and laughs. I love it when the class is positive and engaged!!\\\\n\\\\nI was teaching a topic that most students learn in early high school, if not before. Many students have not seen these topics since then. For others, it\\\\u2019s been even longer if they have been away from high school for a while. The topic was ratios, rates and proportions.\\\\n\\\\nThe nice part about this topic is that there are lots of examples all around us that help students to understand the material.\\\\n\\\\nI told them stories about when I go grocery shopping and take pictures for math class. They thought that it was pretty funny (and I am sure they thought it was geeky too).\\\\n\\\\nIf I can, I like bringing in clips from movies or television and use them as part of the teaching. It\\\\u2019s a fun way to learn math.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"Pile-CC\"}}',\n",

       " '{\"text\": \"Infections of the nail and hoof, known as ungual and/or periungual infections, pose serious problems in dermatology. These ungual and/or periungual can be caused by sources such as fungi, viruses, yeast, bacteria and parasites. Onychomycosis is an example of these serious ungual and/or periungual infections and is caused by at least one fungus. Current treatment for ungual and/or periungual infections generally falls into three categories: systemic administration of medicine; surgical removal of all or part of the nail or hoof followed by topical treatment of the exposed tissue; or topical application of conventional creams, lotions, gels or solutions, frequently including the use of bandages to keep these dosage forms in place on the nail or hoof. All of these approaches have major drawbacks. The following discussion is particularly directed to drawbacks associated with current treatment of ungual and/or periungual antifungal infections.\\\\nLong term systemic (oral) administration of an antifungal agent for the treatment of onychomycosis is often required to produce a therapeutic effect in the nail bed. For example, oral treatment with the antifungal compound ketoconozole typically requires administration of 200 to 400 mg/day for 6 months before any significant therapeutic benefit is realized. Such long term, high dose systemic therapy can have significant adverse effects. For example, ketoconozole has been reported to have liver toxicity effects and reduces testosterone levels in blood due to adverse effects on the testes. Patient compliance is a problem with such long term therapies especially those which involve serious adverse effects. Moreover, this type of long term oral therapy is inconvenient in the treatment of a horse or other ruminants afflicted with fungal infections of the hoof. Accordingly, the risks associated with parenteral treatments generate significant disincentive against their use and considerable patient non-compliance.\\\\nSurgical removal of all or part of the nail followed by topical treatment also has severe drawbacks. The pain and discomfort associated with the surgery and the undesirable cosmetic appearance of the nail or nail bed represent significant problems, particularly for female patients or those more sensitive to physical appearance. Generally, this type of treatment is not realistic for ruminants such as horses.\\\\nTopical therapy has significant problems too. Topical dosage forms such as creams, lotions, gels etc., can not keep the drug in intimate contact with the infected area for therapeutically effective periods of time. Bandages have been used to hold drug reservoirs in place in an attempt to enhance absorption of the pharmaceutical agent. However the bandages are thick, awkward, troublesome and generally lead to poor patient compliance.\\\\nHydrophilic and hydrophobic film forming topical antifungal solutions have also been developed. These dosage forms provide improved contact between the drug and the nail, but the films are not occlusive. Topical formulations for fungal infection treatment have largely tried to deliver the drug to the target site (an infected nail bed) by diffusion across or through the nail.\\\\nNail is more like hair than stratum corneum with respect to chemical composition and permeability. Nitrogen is the major component of the nail attesting to the nail\\'s proteinaceous nature. The total lipid content of mature nail is 0.1-1.0%, while the stratum corneum lipid is about 10% w/w. The nail is 100-200 times thicker than the stratum corneum and has a very high affinity and capacity for binding and retaining antifungal drugs. Consequently little if any drug penetrates through the nail to reach the target site. Because of these reasons topical therapy for fungal infections have generally been ineffective.\\\\nCompounds known as penetration or permeation enhancers are well known in the art to produce an increase in the permeability of skin or other body membranes to a pharmacologically active agent. The increased permeability allows an increase in the rate at which the drug permeates through the skin and enters the blood stream. Penetration enhancers have been successful in overcoming the impermeability of pharmaceutical agents through the skin. However, the thin stratum corneum layer of the skin, which is about 10 to 15 cells thick and is formed naturally by cells migrating toward the skin surface from the basal layer, has been easier to penetrate than nails. Moreover, known penetration enhancers have not proven to be useful in facilitating drug migration through the nail tissue.\\\\nAntimicrobial compositions for controlling bacterial and fungal infections comprising a metal chelate of 8-hydroxyquinoline and an alkyl benzene sulfonic acid have been shown to be efficacious due to the increased ability of the oleophilic group to penetrate the lipoid layers of micro-cells. The compounds however, do not effectively increase the ability to carry the pharmaceutically active antifungal through the cornified layer or stratum corneum of the skin. U.S. Pat. No. 4,602,011, West et al., Jul. 22, 1986; U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,113, West et al., Aug. 23, 1988.\\\\nTherefore, there is a need in the art for compounds which can effectively penetrate the nail. There is also need in the art for compounds which can effectively treat ungual and/or periungual infections. These and other needs are addressed by the current invention.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"USPTO Backgrounds\"}}',\n",

It is another match for them as they are used to hype and big matches. They can take it like 10 other matches. India has played big finals, won trophies.

However, their nanoforms are comparatively less explored. In this context, dielectric constant and polarization (P) versus electric-field (E) characteristics of LiNbO3 nanomaterials have been studied. A nonideal P-E loop and a dielectric constant of 20 at the onset of 1 kHz were seen. The electro-optic sensitivity was found to be 4 times as compared to the bulk LiNbO3 crystals. The results are attributed to oxygen vacancies, antisite defects, and grain boundary effects in an already congruent structural matrix of LiNbO3.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"PubMed Abstracts\"}}',\n",

       " '{\"text\": \"Solar electricity isn\\'t the only renewable energy whipping boy out there. Wind power has also taken more than its share of lumps, frequently saddled with a reputation for excessive noise and energy inefficiency. Plus, if some of the rumors are true, wind harvesters of the world have steadily been turning the planet\\'s bird population into an airborne puree of blood and feathers.\\\\n\\\\nTo be fair, wind turbines do kill birds -- but so do vehicles, skyscrapers, pollution and the introduction of invasive species into their habitats. Humans have had bird blood on their hands for ages, and as daunting as a field of wind turbines may look, they\\'re responsible for statistically few bird deaths -- less than 1 in every 30,000 [source: U.S. Department of Energy].\\\\n\\\\nBut even without the death cries of a thousand birds, aren\\'t wind turbines a noise nuisance? Actually, modern turbine technology renders them relatively silent -- essentially no more than the soft, steady whine of wind through the blades. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, if you stand 750 feet (229 meters) away from a wind farm of multiple turbines, the noise would be no more than that of a working kitchen refrigerator. These aren\\'t helicopter blades, after all. The Ontario Ministry of Environment breaks it down like this: If 0 decibels is the threshold of hearing and 140 is the threshold of pain, then a typical wind farm scores between 35 and 45, sandwiched between a quiet bedroom (35) and a 40-mile-per-hour (64-kilometer-per-hour) car (55).\\\\n\\\\nFinally, there\\'s the issue of cost. Like any energy production facility, there are plenty of upfront costs to harvesting wind energy, but research indicates that the average wind farm pays back the energy used in its manufacture within three to five months of operation [source: BWEA]. Since wind farms depend on variable weather patterns, day-to-day operating costs tend to run higher. Simply put, the wind isn\\'t going to blow at top speed year-round. If it did, a wind turbine would produce its maximum theoretical power. In reality, a turbine only produces 30 percent of this amount, though it produces different levels of electricity 70 to 85 percent of the time [source: BWEA]. This means that wind power requires back-up power from an alternative source, but this is common in energy production.\\\\n\\\\nWind power demonstrates tremendous promise for the future -- and not just for the environment, but for the pocketbook as well. In 2005, the state of New York determined that a 10 percent addition of wind generation would reduce customer payments by $305 million in one year.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"Pile-CC\"}}',\n",

       "['{\"text\": \"South Arabia during World War I\\\\n\\\\nThe campaign in South Arabia during World War I was a minor struggle for control of the port city of Aden, an important way station for ships on their way from Asia to the Suez Canal. The British Empire declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November 1914, and the Ottomans responded with their own declaration on 11 November. From the beginning, the Ottomans had planned an invasion of Britain\\'s Aden Protectorate in cooperation with the local Arab tribes. The Ottomans had gathered in some strength on the Cheikh Sa\\\\u00efd, a peninsula which juts out into the Red Sea towards the island of Perim.\\\\n\\\\nAt the start of the war, the British had one force stationed in the Aden Protectorate, the Aden Brigade, which was part of the British Indian Army. In November 1914, an Ottoman force from Yemen attacked Aden, but was driven off by the Brigade.\\\\n\\\\nLand campaign\\\\n\\\\nCapture of Cheikh Sa\\\\u00efd\\\\nThe 29th Indian Brigade, under Brigadier-General H. V. Cox, CB, then on its way from India to Suez, was ordered to interrupt its voyage to capture Cheikh Sa\\\\u00efd and destroy the Ottoman works, armaments, and wells there. On 10 November transports conveying three battalions of the 29th Indian Brigade and the 23rd Sikh Pioneers arrived off the coast of the peninsula. They were accompanied by the armoured cruiser HMS Duke of Edinburgh, which opened fire on the Ottoman defences while the transports were seeking a satisfactory landing-place. The point that had been at first selected proved impossible on account of the weather, and the troops had to land a little way off under the cover of the fire of the cruiser. They stormed the Ottomans\\' positions and compelled them to retreat, leaving their field guns behind. The sailors took active part in the fighting with the troops, and a naval demolition party assisted, on 11 November, in destroying the Ottoman fortifications. Having accomplished its task, the British force re-embarked and continued on to Suez. It was not considered advisable at this time to push an expedition inland. The Ottomans, consequently, retained some forces on the northern boundary of the Aden Protectorate.\\\\n\\\\nSeven months later they reoccupied Cheikh Sa\\\\u00efd and endeavoured from there to effect a landing on the north coast of Perim. This attack was successfully repulsed by the garrison of the island, the 23rd Sikh Pioneers.\\\\n\\\\nBattle of Lahij\\\\n\\\\nSultanate of Lahij\\\\nIn July 1915 an Ottoman force from North Yemen crossed the frontier of the Aden hinterland and advanced towards Lahij, which was at this time one of the most important towns in South Arabia and the capital of the Abdali Sultanate of Lahij (Lahaj). Placed in an oasis, surrounded by a fertile plain with the deserts beyond, it was the centre of trade between Aden, a British crown colony, and its hinterland, the princely states under a protectorate. In the years leading up to the war, relations between Britain and Lahij had been friendly, the British paying the sultan a subsidy for the occupation of certain land in the interior and protecting him and his agricultural people against the tribes of the desert, who frequently raided them. Propagandising during the war, British historian F. A. McKenzie wrote of the sultan:\\\\nUnder our protection the Sultan of Lahaj had waxed very prosperous. His city, with its palace, its gallows\\\\u2014 built for ornament rather than use\\\\u2014its purely Oriental life, its fine horses, its little show army, and its constant traffic in camels and caravans, seemed like a vision out of the Arabian Nights. When war broke out the Abdali Sultan proved that his loyalty to Britain was real. Though other tribes turned against us he came to our side and prepared to help us. He soon made himself an object of special detestation to the [Ottoman] and to many of the surrounding tribes by his open and unwavering friendship for Britain.\\\\n\\\\nSiege\\\\nThe sultan sent word to General D. G. L. Shaw, commanding the Aden Brigade, that the Ottomans were advancing from Mawiyah to attack him, and asked for help. General Shaw ordered the Aden Movable Column, under Lieutenant-Colonel H. E. A. Pearson, towards Lahij. The Aden Camel Troop was despatched to reconnoitre. It discovered a strong Ottoman force beyond Lahij, supported by a large number of Arab tribesmen. The Camel Troop fell back on Lahij, where it was reinforced by the advance guard of the Movable Column, numbering two hundred and fifty rifles, with two ten-pounder guns. This advance guard had moved up under most trying conditions. The heat was intense, there was great shortage of water, and progress was difficult over the sand. The main body of the Column was so delayed by difficulties of transport and by shortage of water that it did not reach Lahij at all.\\\\n\\\\nThe British in the sultan\\'s capital found themselves faced by several thousand Ottoman troops and twenty guns. In addition, Arab tribesmen had rallied by the thousand to help the Ottomans. The British were backed by the few hundred men of the sultan of Lahij\\'s native army. The Arab camp-followers of the Aden detachment deserted them in a body at the most critical hour, taking with them all their camels. Fighting opened on the evening of Sunday, 4 July. The Ottoman forces made several attacks against the British line, but each was driven off. Although after the battle the efforts of the Royal Artillery drew a tribute from General Shaw, the superior Ottoman artillery had kindled fires in different parts of Lahij, and the British were in danger of being outflanked and cut off by the Arab tribal horsemen. The sultan was killed with many of his men. When the main Aden Column never arrived, the British withdrew on 5 July with the loss of three officers wounded, but the main loss was not so much in men as in prestige.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysis\\\\nIn the official report on the operations issued by the Government of India much stress was laid on \\\\\"the intense heat, sand, and shortage of water\\\\\", and \\\\\"[t]he desertion of the camel-drivers and the severe climatic conditions so delayed and distressed the main body as to necessitate a withdrawal from Lahij\\\\\". McKenzie notes that \\\\\"we do not seem to have made such arrangements for transport and for water supply as would have prepared us for the difficulties which every experienced traveller knew we would have to face. . . But the severe heat of the climate, the potential treachery of hired Arabs, and the shortage of water were all of them factors which had been familiar from the beginning to the Indian authorities, and, one might suppose, ought to have been allowed for.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nReinforcements from India\\\\n\\\\nAfter the debacle at Lahij, the British force fell back on the Kawr. The Ottomans followed them up and occupied Shaikh Othman, a town about two miles inland from the harbour of Aden. This place was formerly part of the Sultanate of Lahij, within the British protectorate. The Ottomans at this stage held practically the whole of the Aden hinterland, except immediately around the crown colony itself. They had reoccupied Cheikh Sa\\\\u00efd and had destroyed Lahij. The Indian authorities, under Commander-in-Chief Beauchamp Duff, decided to increase the Aden garrison after \\\\\"subsequent Turkish victories\\\\\". Major-General Sir George J. Younghusband, a soldier with a distinguished career, succeeded to the command of the Aden Brigade.\\\\n\\\\nOn 20 July 1915, troops from the Aden Brigade, the 28th Indian Brigade, 1/B Battery, HAC, 1/1st Berkshire Battery, RHA, and a detachment of Sappers and Miners, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel A. M. S. Elsmie, a soldier well trained in frontier fighting, surprised the Ottomans at Shaikh Othman, completely defeated them and drove them out of the place. Between fifty and sixty Ottoman soldiers were killed and wounded, and several hundred men, mostly Arab tribesmen, were made prisoners. This success was followed up in the following month by an attack by a small column on an Ottoman post between Lahij and Shaikh Othman. The Ottomans were driven from the town. Another attack in a different direction was equally successful. Reports reached Aden that the Ottomans were preparing to retire from Lahij itself, and in September a column under Colonel Elsmie set out in the direction of Waht. Here it surprised a force of seven hundred Ottomans, with eight guns, who were supported by about a thousand Arabs. The Ottomans were driven back, and Waht fell to the British troops, who had been aided both on sea and land by the cooperation of the cruiser HMS Philomel of the New Zealand Naval Forces, under Captain Percival Hill-Thompson.\\\\n\\\\nOttoman claims of victory\\\\nA series of minor engagements and skirmishes between the Ottomans and Arabs and the British followed, during which the latter were generally successful, but found it impossible to hold the country far inland. Early in 1916 the Ottomans claimed that the British had been driven back on to Aden itself, and had retreated to within range of the covering fire of their warships, where they had been inactive for some months. Many of the Ottoman claims were greatly exaggerated, and some wholly false. In February 1916, Major John Pretyman Newman, MP, asked in the British Parliament for any information about the fighting near Aden. Austen Chamberlain, then Secretary of State for India, responded that the Ottoman claim of success which had recently been put forward would seem to have been founded on an engagement which took place on 12 January between a reconnoitring column of the Aden garrison and an Ottoman force in the neighbourhood of Shaikh Othman. The loss on our side was one British officer and thirty-five Indian rank and file killed, and four British and thirty-five Indian rank and file wounded. The enemy losses were severe, amounting to about two hundred killed and wounded. The British column was neither annihilated nor defeated, but withdrew when the purpose of the movement was completed, Chamberlain said.\\\\n\\\\nLater on, the Ottomans officially claimed to have scored a substantial victory in further heavy fighting around Shaikh Othman and Bir Ahmad. This was a sheer invention. In January 1916, the Aden Movable Column moved out to protect some friendly troops to the east of the Aden Protectorate against Ottoman troops who had been sent to coerce them. The column located the Ottoman force near Subar, and defeated it. The general position was so unsatisfactory, however, that in April 1916, it was decided, on the suggestion of the Government of India, that ladies should not be allowed to land at Aden without receiving permission from the Commander-in-Chief in India.\\\\n\\\\nEnd of the campaign in South Arabia\\\\nThe eruption of the British-sponsored Arab Revolt in the Hejaz diverted Ottoman attention from Aden in the summer of 1916. Those Ottoman troops which remained reverted to the defensive, while the British built an eleven-mile-long defensive perimeter around Aden. They did not attempt to resecure lost territories in the hinterland, and no major fighting with the British took place after 1916. The Ottomans continued to hold territories in the protectorate until the Armistice of Mudros in October 1918 and the partition of the Ottoman Empire after the war.\\\\n\\\\nNaval campaign\\\\n\\\\nUses of the South Arab ports during the war\\\\nOn 18 October 1914, a convoy of ten troopships carrying the New Zealand Expeditionary Force was escorted by the Imperial Japanese battlecruiser Ibuki out of Wellington. It joined a group of twenty-eight ships carrying the First Australian Imperial Force, and the total convoy, with Ibuki and the Australian cruiser , crossed the ocean, which was being patrolled by the Japanese protected cruiser Chikuma. While Sydney was sidetracked, and ended up in the Battle of Cocos, the rest of the convoy reached Aden on 25 October.\\\\n\\\\nOn 9 November 1914, a small landing party, numbering five officers, one surgeon, and forty-seven petty officers and men, under Lieutenant Hellmuth von M\\\\u00fccke, was separated from their ship, the SMS Emden during the Battle of Cocos, and piloted the Ayesha to the Dutch port of Padang on the west coast of Sumatra. There von M\\\\u00fccke arranged a rendezvous with the German freighter Choising, which transported him and his men to the Ottoman city of Hodeida in Yemen. Once on the Arabian Peninsula, von M\\\\u00fccke and his men experienced months of delay securing the assistance of local Turkish officials to return to Germany. At last he decided to lead his men on an over-water voyage up the east coast of the Red Sea to Jiddah. Ultimately, Von M\\\\u00fccke and forty-eight of his men returned to Berlin.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the Arabs of the revolt of June 1916 attacked the port of Jiddah, they were supported by the seaplane carrier , based at Aden.\\\\n\\\\nOccupation of Kamaran\\\\nOn 17 February 1915, the British Resident in Aden, Brigadier William Crawford Walton, wired the Government of India that dhows bearing telegrams, mail and money from Jiddah had made it to Ottoman headquarters in Yemen, and that it was necessary that these be stopped. He proposed the occopuation of Kamaran with 200 men from the RMS Empress of Russia, the RMS Empress of Asia and HMS Minto. This had the support of the Admiralty, the Commander-in-Chief at Port Said\\\\u2014who wished to use Kamaran as a \\\\\"naval base for small vessels\\\\\"\\\\u2014and the India Office, which duly informed the Viceroy of India to give the necessary orders. The viceroy demurred, fearing that the local population would be \\\\\"unlikely to acquiesce\\\\\", that an occupation might \\\\\"alarm the Idrisi\\\\\", was likely to be misunderstood by Muslims, and would reduce the defences of Aden, at just the moment when the Turks were advancing. On 3 March the India Office rescinded its order, but when intelligence suggested that some Germans stranded in Massawa in Italian Eritrea at the outbreak of war were attempting to sail across the sea to Arabia, the resident renewed his request for 200 men (7 March). Again the viceroy refused (11 March).\\\\n\\\\nReferences\\\\n\\\\nFurther reading\\\\n\\\\n Bidwell, Robin L. \\\\\"The Turkish attack on Aden 1915\\\\u20131918\\\\\", Arabian Studies, 6 (1982), 171\\\\u201394.\\\\n Bruce, Anthony.

       " '{\"text\": \"Solar electricity isn\\'t the only renewable energy whipping boy out there. Wind power has also taken more than its share of lumps, frequently saddled with a reputation for excessive noise and energy inefficiency. Plus, if some of the rumors are true, wind harvesters of the world have steadily been turning the planet\\'s bird population into an airborne puree of blood and feathers.\\\\n\\\\nTo be fair, wind turbines do kill birds -- but so do vehicles, skyscrapers, pollution and the introduction of invasive species into their habitats. Humans have had bird blood on their hands for ages, and as daunting as a field of wind turbines may look, they\\'re responsible for statistically few bird deaths -- less than 1 in every 30,000 [source: U.S. Department of Energy].\\\\n\\\\nBut even without the death cries of a thousand birds, aren\\'t wind turbines a noise nuisance? Actually, modern turbine technology renders them relatively silent -- essentially no more than the soft, steady whine of wind through the blades. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, if you stand 750 feet (229 meters) away from a wind farm of multiple turbines, the noise would be no more than that of a working kitchen refrigerator. These aren\\'t helicopter blades, after all. The Ontario Ministry of Environment breaks it down like this: If 0 decibels is the threshold of hearing and 140 is the threshold of pain, then a typical wind farm scores between 35 and 45, sandwiched between a quiet bedroom (35) and a 40-mile-per-hour (64-kilometer-per-hour) car (55).\\\\n\\\\nFinally, there\\'s the issue of cost. Like any energy production facility, there are plenty of upfront costs to harvesting wind energy, but research indicates that the average wind farm pays back the energy used in its manufacture within three to five months of operation [source: BWEA]. Since wind farms depend on variable weather patterns, day-to-day operating costs tend to run higher. Simply put, the wind isn\\'t going to blow at top speed year-round. If it did, a wind turbine would produce its maximum theoretical power. In reality, a turbine only produces 30 percent of this amount, though it produces different levels of electricity 70 to 85 percent of the time [source: BWEA]. This means that wind power requires back-up power from an alternative source, but this is common in energy production.\\\\n\\\\nWind power demonstrates tremendous promise for the future -- and not just for the environment, but for the pocketbook as well. In 2005, the state of New York determined that a 10 percent addition of wind generation would reduce customer payments by $305 million in one year.\", \"meta\": {\"pile_set_name\": \"Pile-CC\"}}',\n",
